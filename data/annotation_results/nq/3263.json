The compact requires the Upper\nBasin states not to deplete the flow of the river below 7,500,000 acre feet\n(9.3 km3) during any period of ten consecutive years. Based on rainfall\npatterns observed in the years before the treaty's signing in 1922, the amount\nspecified in the compact was assumed to allow a roughly equal division of\nwater between the two regions. The states within each basin were required to\ndivide their 7,500,000-acre (30,000 km2) foot per year (289 m³/s) share\nallotment among themselves. The compact enabled the widespread\n[irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation \"Irrigation\") of the Southwest, as well as the\nsubsequent development of state and federal water works projects under the\n[United States Bureau of\nReclamation](/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation \"United States Bureau\nof Reclamation\"). Such projects included the [Hoover Dam](/wiki/Hoover_Dam\n\"Hoover Dam\") and [Lake Powell](/wiki/Lake_Powell \"Lake Powell\").\n\nThe current specific annual allotments in the Lower Basin were established in\n1928 as part of the [Boulder Canyon Project](/wiki/Boulder_Canyon_Project\n\"Boulder Canyon Project\"), while the current specific annual allotments in the\nUpper Basin were established by the Upper Colorado River Basin Compact of\n1948.[2] They are:\n\nUpper Basin, 7.5 million acre·ft/year (293 m³/s) total  \n---  \nColorado | 51.75%* | 3.86 million acre·ft/year (150.7 m³/s)  \nUtah | 23.00%* | 1.71 million acre·ft/year (67.0 m³/s)  \nWyoming | 14.00%* | 1.04 million acre·ft/year (40.8 m³/s)  \nNew Mexico | 11.25%* | 0.84 million acre·ft/year (32.8 m³/s)  \nArizona | 0.70% | 0.05 million acre·ft/year (2.0 m³/s)  \n*Percentages with a star are a percentage of the total _after_ Arizona's  \n0.05 million are deducted. Arizona's percentage is of the total.  \nLower Basin, 7.5 million acre·ft/year (293 m³/s) total  \nCalifornia | 58.70% | 4.40 million acre·ft/year (172 m³/s)  \nArizona | 37.30% | 2.80 million acre·ft/year (109 m³/s)  \nNevada | 4.00% | 0.30 million acre·ft/year (12 m³/s)  \n  \nIn addition to this, 1,500,000-acre-foot (1.9×109 m3)/year of Colorado River\nwater is allocated to Mexico, pursuant to the treaty relating to the use of\nwaters of the Colorado and [Tijuana rivers](/wiki/Tijuana_River \"Tijuana\nRiver\") and of the [Rio Grande](/wiki/Rio_Grande \"Rio Grande\"), signed\nFebruary 3, 1944, and its supplementary protocol signed November 14, 1944.\nAlso, the lower basin can get an additional 1,100,000-acre-foot (1.4×109\nm3)/year in surplus conditions.[3]\n\nThe compact was the fruit of several years of negotiations among the states.\nThe seven states had previously formed the [League of the\nSouthwest](/wiki/League_of_the_Southwest \"League of the Southwest\") in 1917 to\npromote development along the river.[4] In 1921,\n[Congress](/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States \"Congress of the United\nStates\") authorized the states to enter into a compact for allocation of the\nriver resources. The agreement was approved by Congress in 1922, the same year\nit was signed. Colorado River Compact was signed by the delegates from the\nseven Colorado River Basin states: Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico were\ndesignated Upper Basin states and California, Arizona and Nevada as the Lower\nBasin states. This compact determined that the water would be shared equally\namong the upper and lower basin states. Prior to the compact, the name of the\nriver was standardized along its length. Previously the portion of the river\nupstream from its confluence with the [Green\nRiver](/wiki/Green_River_\\(Colorado_River\\) \"Green River \\(Colorado River\\)\")\nhad been known locally as the \"Grand River\". The change was opposed by many\nlocal residents in Utah and Colorado, and the new name was enforced locally by\nacts of the state legislatures in both states in the early 1920s. One of the\nmajor concerns both today and back in the 1920s was the expanding population,\nand this increased the demand for water, particularly in California. In more\nrecent years, mainly because of Las Vegas, Nevada has been looking for more\nuse of the Colorado River.[5]\n\nIn 1934, Arizona, unhappy with California's decision to dam and divert the\nriver, called out the National Guard and even commissioned a two boat \"navy.\"\nThe matter was eventually settled in court.[6]\n\nThe agreement was controversial even at the time, however. Arizona, for\nexample, was dissatisfied with the lower basin allotment.[7] Led by [Fred\nColter](/wiki/Fred_Colter \"Fred Colter\"), the state refused to sign the\nagreement, and did not do so until two months after Colter's death in\n1944.[8]:17–18 The specific allotments were disputed by Arizona until the\n[United States Supreme Court](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United States\nSupreme Court\") upheld the amount in the 1963 decision in _[Arizona v.\nCalifornia](/wiki/Arizona_v._California \"Arizona v. California\")_. The\nagreement ended many years of dispute, clearing the way for the [Central\nArizona Project](/wiki/Central_Arizona_Project \"Central Arizona Project\"),\nauthorized by Congress in 1968. Mexico was able to gain some of the river\nrights, Arizona took steps to protect its water rights and keep from\nCalifornia gaining too large of a share, which ultimately led to the Arizona\nv. California supreme Court Case.[9] The Arizona v. Colorado court case lasted\n11 years and cost over $5 million and 50 lawyers.[10] This case set the\nprecedent of SCOTus using water rights. The case ultimately decided that the\nBoulder Canyon Provision was correct for the lower states (which are\nCalifornia, Nevada, and Arizona).[11] The Court ultimately ruled in favor of\nArizona, however they agreed with the way that California interpreted that it\ngot surplus water was correct and so there was essentially some compromise on\nboth sides.\n\n## Future developments and\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Colorado_River_Compact&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Future developments and issues\")]\n\nSince the development of the Colorado River Compact, California has been using\nthe surplus water that has been left over from other states. With increasing\npopulation growth in the Southwest there is concern that this surplus soon\nwill not exist for California’s use. In 2001, Secretary of the Interior Bruce\nBabbitt signed an interim agreement, determining how water surplus from the\nColorado River will be allocated between the states, and creating a fifteen-\nyear period to allow California time to put conservation methods in place to\nreduce the state’s water usage and dependence on Colorado River water.[12]\n\nThere is also concern regarding Nevada’s increasing population and the state’s\nwater usage. Nevada, with the smallest water allocation in the lower river\nbasin, may find in the near future that the water supplied by the Colorado\nRiver will not meet the state’s growing needs. In 2008 Southern Nevada Water\nAuthority General Manager Pat Mulroy said that she does not support a water\nreallocation. This is because all of the states in the river basin have\nexperienced growth she says that it is unlikely that Nevada’s allocation would\nincrease, and it could even decrease.[13] Instead Nevada, like California, may\nhave to work on conservation methods as well as finding other water sources to\nsupport the state’s growing population.\n\nDevelopment was the prime concern of the Colorado River Compact, when signed\nin 1922. Using and reusing the river water as well as frequent damming results\nin an unfavorable environment for native fish species. Dams block fish\npassage, reduce natural silt deposition along flood plains and in deltas, and\nchange water temperatures—all negatively impacting the natural ecosystem.[14]\nThe high water usage has also caused the river delta, located in Mexico, to\nsignificantly deteriorate. Once a lush and green area from the high amounts of\nsilt deposit, the plentiful ecosystem has now all but disappeared. The\nColorado River had been over allocated since the beginning of its time, as\nduring the signing of the Colorado River Compact, the flows were vastly\noverestimated and much more generous than they should have been. It was\noriginally estimated to have 17 million acre-feet a year, but even prior to\nthe drought flows have often been less than a third of that.[11]\n\n## Criticism and\nrenegotiation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Colorado_River_Compact&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Criticism and renegotiation\")]\n\nIn recent years, the compact has become the focus of even sharper criticism,\nin the wake of a protracted decrease in precipitation in the region.\nSpecifically, the amount of water allocated was based on an expectation that\nthe river's average flow was 16,400,000 acre feet (20.2 km3) per year (641\nm³/s). Subsequent [tree ring](/wiki/Tree_ring \"Tree ring\") studies, however,\nhave concluded that the long-term average water flow of the Colorado is\nsignificantly less. Estimates have included 13,200,000 acre feet (16.3 km3)\nper year (516 m³/s),[14] 13,500,000 acre feet (16.7 km3) per year (528\nm3/s),[15] and 14,300,000 acre feet (17.6 km3) per year (559 m3/s).[16] Many\nanalysts have concluded that when the compact was negotiated, the period used\nas the basis for \"average\" flow of the river (1905–1922) included periods of\nabnormally high precipitation,[17] and that the recent [drought](/wiki/Drought\n\"Drought\") in the region is in fact a return to historically typical patterns.\nThe decrease in precipitation has led to widespread dropping of\n[reservoir](/wiki/Reservoir_\\(water\\) \"Reservoir \\(water\\)\") levels in the\nregion, in particular at [Lake Powell](/wiki/Lake_Powell \"Lake Powell\"),\ncreated by the [Glen Canyon Dam](/wiki/Glen_Canyon_Dam \"Glen Canyon Dam\") in\n1963, where the exposure of long-inundated canyons has prompted calls for the\nreservoir to be permanently drained and decommissioned.\n\nIn December 2007, a set of interim guidelines on how to allocate Colorado\nRiver water in the event of shortages was signed by the Secretary of the\nInterior.[3][18] The guidelines are described as interim because they extend\nthrough 2026, and, \"acknowledging the potential for impacts due to climate\nchange and increased hydrologic variability,\" interim guidelines provide \"the\nopportunity to gain valuable operating experience for the management of Lake\nPowell and Lake Mead, particularly for low reservoir conditions...whether\nduring the interim period or thereafter.\"[19] The agreement specifies three\nlevels of shortage conditions, depending on the level of [Lake\nMead](/wiki/Lake_Mead \"Lake Mead\"):\n\n  * **Light shortage.** When the surface elevation at Lake Mead is below 1,075 feet (328 m) relative to mean sea level but above 1,050 feet (320 m), the Lower Basin states will receive 7,167,000 acre feet (8.840 km3) per year: 4,400,000 acre feet (5.4 km3) to California, 2,480,000 acre feet (3.06 km3) to Arizona, and 287,000 acre feet (0.354 km3) to Nevada.\n  * **Heavy shortage.** When the surface elevation of Lake Mead is below 1,050 feet (320 m) but above 1,025 feet (312 m), 7,083,000 acre feet (8.737 km3) per year will be delivered to the Lower Basin states: 4,400,000 acre feet (5.4 km3) to California, 2,400,000 acre feet (3.0 km3) to Arizona, and 283,000 acre feet (0.349 km3) to Nevada.\n  * **Extreme shortage.** The most severe shortage considered in the interim guidelines is when the level of Lake Mead drops below 1,025 feet (312 m), in which event 7,000,000 acre feet (8.6 km3) per year will be delivered to the Lower Basin states: 4,000,000 acre feet (4.9 km3) to California, 2,320,000 acre feet (2.86 km3) to Arizona, and 280,000 acre feet (0.35 km3) to Nevada.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, Arizona Senator [John McCain](/wiki/John_McCain \"John\nMcCain\") called for the compact to be renegotiated.[20] Due to the Senator's\nposition as the Republican Party nominee in the [2008 U.S. Presidential\nElection](/wiki/2008_U.S._Presidential_Election \"2008 U.S. Presidential\nElection\") and Colorado's [swing state](/wiki/Swing_state \"Swing state\")\nstatus, criticism of the compact may have gained national significance.[21]\n\n**Minute 319.** On November 20, 2012, the [International Boundary and Water\nCommission](/wiki/International_Boundary_and_Water_Commission \"International\nBoundary and Water Commission\") of the United States and Mexico signed an\nagreement termed \"Minute 319,\" which updated the Law of the River to address\nhow the 1,500,000 acre feet (1.9 km3) of Colorado River water that Mexico\nreceives every year would be affected by surplus or drought conditions.[22]\nUnder surplus conditions (when the surface elevation of Lake Mead is above\n1,145 feet (349 m) relative to mean sea level) the annual flow to Mexico will\nincrease by 40,000 acre feet (0.049 km3). In cases where the surface elevation\nof Lake Mead is higher than that, the extra deliveries to Mexico progressively\nincrease, reaching a maximum of an additional 200,000 acre feet (0.25 km3) per\nyear.\n\nMinute 319 also specifies that deliveries to Mexico will be reduced under\ndrought conditions. Starting from the base allocation of 1,500,000 acre feet\n(1.9 km3) per year, annual deliveries will be reduced by 50,000 acre feet\n(0.062 km3) if the surface elevation of Lake Mead is between 1,075 feet (328\nm) and 1,050 feet (320 m) above mean sea level; reduced by 70,000 acre feet\n(0.086 km3) acre-feet if the elevation is 1,050 feet (320 m) to 1,025 feet\n(312 m); and reduced by 125,000 acre feet (0.154 km3) if the surface elevation\nis below 1,025 feet (312 m).\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Colorado_River_Compact&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Bureau of Reclamation: Lower Colorado Region - Law of the River\"](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/lawofrvr.html). _Usbr.gov_. 2005-03-21.
