She is a\nfoul-tempered monarch whom Carroll himself describes as \"a blind fury\", and\nwho is quick to give death sentences at the slightest offense. One of her most\nfamous lines she states often is \"[Off with their heads](/wiki/Decapitation\n\"Decapitation\")!\"\n\nThe Queen is referred to as a card from a pack of [playing\ncards](/wiki/Playing_card \"Playing card\") by Alice, yet somehow she is able to\ntalk and is the ruler of the lands in the story, alongside her tiny husband,\nthe [King of\nHearts](/wiki/King_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"King of\nHearts \\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\"). She is often confused with the\n[Red Queen](/wiki/Red_Queen_\\(Through_the_Looking-Glass\\) \"Red Queen \\(Through\nthe Looking-Glass\\)\") from the sequel, _[Through the Looking-\nGlass](/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass \"Through the Looking-Glass\")_ ,\nalthough the two are very different.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Origins\n  * 3 Illustrations\n  * 4 Confusion with the Red Queen\n  * 5 Adaptions\n    * 5.1 Disney\n    * 5.2 Tim Burton's _Alice in Wonderland_ (2010)\n    * 5.3 _American McGee 's Alice_\n    * 5.4 The Looking-Glass Wars\n    * 5.5 Alice in the Country of Hearts\n    * 5.6 SyFy TV miniseries\n    * 5.7 Once Upon a Time\n    * 5.8 Other versions and adaptations\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Citations\n\n##\nOverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\n[Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"Alice \\(Alice's\nAdventures in Wonderland\\)\") observes three playing cards painting white roses\nred. They drop to the ground face down at the approach of the Queen of Hearts,\nwhom Alice has never met. When the Queen arrives and asks Alice who is lying\non the ground (since the backs of all playing cards look alike), Alice tells\nher that she does not know. The Queen then becomes frustrated and commands\nthat her head be severed. She is deterred by her comparatively moderate\nhusband by being reminded that Alice is only a child.\n\nGenerally, however, as we are told by Carroll:\n\n    _The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round._\n\nOne of the Queen's hobbies – besides ordering executions – is\n[croquet](/wiki/Croquet \"Croquet\"); however it is Wonderland croquet, where\nthe balls are live [hedgehogs](/wiki/Hedgehog \"Hedgehog\") and the mallets are\n[flamingoes](/wiki/Flamingo \"Flamingo\"). This is presumably with the aim that\nthe birds' blunt beaks should strike, but, as Alice observes, it is\ncomplicated by the fact that they keep looking back up at the players- as well\nas the hedgehogs' tendency to scuttle away without waiting to be hit. The\nQueen's soldiers act as the arches (or hoops) on the croquet grounds, but have\nto leave off being arches every time the Queen has an executioner drag away\nthe victim, so that, by the end of the game in the story, the only players\nthat remain are the Queen herself, the King, and Alice.\n\nDespite the frequency of death sentences, it would appear few people are\nactually beheaded, [the King of\nHearts](/wiki/King_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"King of\nHearts \\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\"), quietly pardons many of his\nsubjects when the Queen is not looking (although this did not seem to be the\ncase with [The Duchess](/wiki/Duchess_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)\n\"Duchess \\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\")), and her soldiers humor her\nbut do not carry out her orders. [The\nGryphon](/wiki/Gryphon_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"Gryphon\n\\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\") tells Alice, \"It's all her\n[fancy](/w/index.php?title=Fancy_\\(interest\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fancy\n\\(interest\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"): she never executes nobody, you know.\"\nNevertheless, all creatures in Wonderland fear the Queen. In the final\nchapters, the Queen sentences Alice again (for defending the [Knave of\nHearts](/wiki/Knave_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"Knave of\nHearts \\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\")), and she offers a bizarre\napproach towards [justice](/wiki/Justice \"Justice\"): sentence before verdict.\n\nModern portrayals in popular culture usually let her play the role of a\nvillain because of the menace the character exemplifies, but in the book she\ndoes not fill that purpose. She is just one of the many obstacles that Alice\nhas to encounter on the journey, but unlike other obstacles, she makes a\nhigher potential threat.\n\n##\nOrigins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Origins\")]\n\nThe Queen is believed by\nsome[_[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] to be a caricature of [Queen\nVictoria](/wiki/Queen_Victoria \"Queen Victoria\"), with elements of reality\nthat Dodgson felt correctly would make her at once instantly recognizable to\nparents reading the story to children, and also fantastical enough to make her\nunrecognizable to children. The reference is explicit in [Jonathan\nMiller](/wiki/Jonathan_Miller \"Jonathan Miller\")'s [1966 television\nversion](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(1966_TV_play\\) \"Alice in Wonderland\n\\(1966 TV play\\)\") where she and the King of Hearts are portrayed without any\nattempt at fantasy, or disguise as to their true natures or personality.\n\nThe Queen may also be a reference to [Queen Margaret](/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou\n\"Margaret of Anjou\") of the [House of Lancaster](/wiki/House_of_Lancaster\n\"House of Lancaster\"). During the [War of the Roses](/wiki/War_of_the_Roses\n\"War of the Roses\"), a red rose was the symbol of the House Lancaster. Their\nrivals, the [House of York](/wiki/House_of_York \"House of York\"), had a white\nrose for their symbol. The gardeners' painting the white roses red may be a\nreference to these two houses.\n\n##\nIllustrations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Illustrations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Elizabeth_de_Mowbray_Duchess_of_Norfolk_2.jpg/200px-\nElizabeth_de_Mowbray_Duchess_of_Norfolk_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Elizabeth_de_Mowbray_Duchess_of_Norfolk_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Elizabeth_de_Mowbray_Duchess_of_Norfolk_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nImage of [Elizabeth de Mowbray, Duchess of\nNorfolk](/wiki/Elizabeth_de_Mowbray,_Duchess_of_Norfolk \"Elizabeth de Mowbray,\nDuchess of Norfolk\") that inspired the original illustrations of the Queen of\nHearts.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to illustrate _Alice 's Adventures in\nWonderland_ himself, Lewis Carroll was persuaded to engage a professional\nartist to provide the illustrations. He turned to cartoonist [John\nTenniel](/wiki/John_Tenniel \"John Tenniel\"), who was known for his regular\ncontributions to the satirical magazine _[Punch](/wiki/Punch_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Punch \\(magazine\\)\")_ (published 1841–1992, 1996–2002).\n\nTenniel's inspiration for the Queen of Hearts was an image of [Elizabeth de\nMowbray, Duchess of Norfolk](/wiki/Elizabeth_de_Mowbray,_Duchess_of_Norfolk\n\"Elizabeth de Mowbray, Duchess of Norfolk\") in one of the medieval stained\nglass windows at [Holy Trinity Church, Long\nMelford](/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Church,_Long_Melford \"Holy Trinity Church, Long\nMelford\"), Suffolk.[1]\n\nThe illustrations for the _Alice_ books were engraved onto blocks of wood, to\nbe printed in the [wood engraving](/wiki/Wood_engraving \"Wood engraving\")\nprocess. The original wood blocks are now in the collection of the [Bodleian\nLibrary](/wiki/Bodleian_Library \"Bodleian Library\") in [Oxford](/wiki/Oxford\n\"Oxford\"), England. They are not usually on public display, but were exhibited\nin 2003.\n\n## Confusion with the Red\nQueen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Confusion with the Red Queen\")]\n\nShe is commonly mistaken for the [Red\nQueen](/wiki/Red_Queen_\\(Through_the_Looking_Glass\\) \"Red Queen \\(Through the\nLooking Glass\\)\") in the story's sequel, _[Through the Looking-\nGlass](/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass \"Through the Looking-Glass\")_ , but in\nreality shares none of her characteristics other than being a queen. Indeed,\nCarroll, in his lifetime, made the distinction of the two Queens by saying:\n\n“ | \n\n    I pictured to myself the Queen of Hearts as a sort of embodiment of ungovernable [passion](/wiki/Passion_\\(emotion\\) \"Passion \\(emotion\\)\") – a blind and aimless [Fury](/wiki/Erinyes \"Erinyes\").\n    The Red Queen I pictured as a Fury, but of another type; her passion must be cold and calm – she must be formal and strict, yet not unkindly; pedantic to the 10th degree, the concentrated essence of all [governesses](/wiki/Governess \"Governess\")![2]\n| ”  \n---|---|---  \n— [Lewis Carroll](/wiki/Lewis_Carroll \"Lewis Carroll\"), in \"Alice on the\nStage\"  \n  \nThe 1951 animated film _[Alice in\nWonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(Disney\\) \"Alice in Wonderland\n\\(Disney\\)\")_ perpetuates the long-standing confusion between the Red Queen\nand the [Queen of Hearts](/wiki/Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice_character\\) \"Queen of\nHearts \\(Alice character\\)\"). In the film, the Queen of Hearts delivers\nseveral of the Red Queen's statements, the most notable being based on her\n\"all the ways about here belong to me\". Both characters say this to suggest\nimportance and possible arrogance, but in the Red Queen's case it has a double\nmeaning since her status as a Chess-queen means that she can move in any\ndirection she desires.\n\nIn the _[American McGee's Alice](/wiki/American_McGee%27s_Alice \"American\nMcGee's Alice\")_ adaptation of the books, the characters are also conflated,\nleading to further popular misconception.\n\n##\nAdaptions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Adaptions\")]\n\n###\nDisney[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Disney\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/DisneyQueenHearts.jpg/200px-\nDisneyQueenHearts.jpg)](/wiki/File:DisneyQueenHearts.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DisneyQueenHearts.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDisney's adaptation of the Queen of Hearts.\n\nIn the Disney animated feature _[Alice in\nWonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(1951_film\\) \"Alice in Wonderland\n\\(1951 film\\)\")_ , the Queen of Hearts is the main antagonist who appears as\nAlice puts it in a moment of temper, a \"fat, pompous, bad tempered old\ntyrant\". The character was voiced by [Verna Felton](/wiki/Verna_Felton \"Verna\nFelton\"). She is portrayed as a [haughty](/wiki/Haughty \"Haughty\")\n[sadist](/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder \"Sadistic personality disorder\"),\nwho enjoys [decapitating](/wiki/Decapitating \"Decapitating\") anyone who merely\nannoys her. Her presence is all the more striking because of how tiny her\nhusband the King is (he barely comes up to her knee). Similar to the book,\nAlice meets three cards painting the roses red, since they planted white roses\nby mistake. When the Queen arrives, she orders those three cards beheaded,\nthen turns her attention to Alice. Refusing to answer her questions with\npresumption that only she can ask them, she quickly ropes her into a game of\n[croquet](/wiki/Croquet \"Croquet\"). The game ends with the Queen tripping\nherself over, due to the [Cheshire Cat](/wiki/Cheshire_Cat \"Cheshire Cat\")'s\nmischievous antics. The Queen angrily blames Alice for it, but before she can\ngive the order, the King suggests holding a trial for Alice. The Queen,\ngrudgingly, but reasonably, agrees. The Queen calls the [March\nHare](/wiki/March_Hare \"March Hare\"), the\n[Dormouse](/wiki/Dormouse_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"Dormouse\n\\(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\)\"), and the [Mad Hatter](/wiki/Mad_Hatter\n\"Mad Hatter\") to witness, who hold an unbirthday party for her and cheer her\nup considerably. During the party, the Cheshire Cat reappears and upsets the\nDormouse. The frightened Dormouse runs all over, and in an attempt to crush\nthe mouse, the King of Hearts accidentally hits the Queen on the head with the\n[gavel](/wiki/Gavel \"Gavel\"), which is hastily passed into the March Hare's\nhands, then the Hatter's, and finally Alice's. The Queen, of course, blames\nAlice for it, and is going to have her beheaded. But Alice eats mushrooms she\nhad procured earlier, which make her grow bigger. Although Rule No. 42 says\nthat anyone more than a mile high must leave the court immediately, Alice\nfeels free to call the queen a \"fat, pompous, bad tempered old tyrant\".\nUnfortunately, she subsequently shrinks down to her normal size, but flees and\nis able to escape.\n\nOf interest is the fact that Disney's Queen of Hearts seems to be an\n[amalgamation](/wiki/Amalgamation_\\(fiction\\) \"Amalgamation \\(fiction\\)\") of\nthe Queen from the book, the Duchess, and the Red Queen of _[Through The\nLooking-Glass](/wiki/Through_The_Looking-Glass \"Through The Looking-Glass\")_.\nWhen pleased, she can be quite pleasant, but is still bossy and often\nimpatient, and can almost at once change to enraged.\n\nAs she is considered to be one of the members of the [Disney\nVillains](/wiki/Disney_Villains \"Disney Villains\") group of characters, the\nQueen of Hearts exacted her revenge upon Alice in the game _[Disney's\nVillains' Revenge](/wiki/Disney%27s_Villains%27_Revenge \"Disney's Villains'\nRevenge\")_ where she stole the ending page of the story and changed the\nending, so Alice lost her head. [Jiminy Cricket](/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket \"Jiminy\nCricket\"), the player, and Alice's headless body retrieve the head and escape\nthe labyrinth of the Queen. They meet one last time in the final battle and\nshe surrenders. The Queen of Hearts is the [final\nboss](/wiki/Boss_\\(video_gaming\\) \"Boss \\(video gaming\\)\") on the Japanese\nversion of _[Mickey Mousecapade](/wiki/Mickey_Mousecapade \"Mickey\nMousecapade\")_ , a 1987 video game where Alice is her hostage. She is also a\ngreetable character at the [Walt Disney World\nResort](/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Resort \"Walt Disney World Resort\"). In\n_[Mickey's House of Villains](/wiki/Mickey%27s_House_of_Villains \"Mickey's\nHouse of Villains\")_, the Queen of Hearts appears as one of the villain guests\nof the _House of Mouse_ , voiced by [Tress MacNeille](/wiki/Tress_MacNeille\n\"Tress MacNeille\").\n\nThe Queen appears in the [Square-Enix](/wiki/Square-Enix \"Square-\nEnix\")/[Disney](/wiki/Disney \"Disney\") video game _[Kingdom\nHearts](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts \"Kingdom Hearts\")_ , in her homeworld. As in the\nfilm, she holds Alice on trial, only this time for attempting to steal her\nheart. The main heroes in the game, Sora, Donald and Goofy, intervene, telling\nthe Queen that Alice is innocent. The Queen challenges them to provide proof\nof their theory, and with help from the Cheshire Cat, the three are able to do\nso. The Queen, however, enraged at being proven wrong, orders them executed\nand Alice imprisoned in a cage on the roof. The three are able to fight off\nthe Queen's guards and destroy the cage controls, but Alice is kidnapped,\nbefore they can save her. The Queen orders a search for Alice, and temporarily\npardons Sora, Donald and Goofy, requesting that they look for Alice as well.\nShe returns in _[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of\nMemories](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories \"Kingdom Hearts: Chain of\nMemories\")_ , only this time as a figment of Sora's memories. Again, she holds\nAlice on trial, this time for attempting to steal her memories. In both games,\nSora, Donald and Goofy prove Alice's innocence by defeating the Trickmaster\nHeartless, the real culprit. The Queen congratulates Sora for solving the\nmystery, and once again demonstrates her bi-polar personality by pardoning\nAlice. She is absent in _[Kingdom Hearts II](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II \"Kingdom\nHearts II\")_ , but appears in _[Kingdom Hearts 358/2\nDays](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_358/2_Days \"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\")_ along with\nher homeworld. A digital version of her later appears in _[Kingdom Hearts\ncoded](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_coded \"Kingdom Hearts coded\")_.\n\n### Tim Burton's _Alice in Wonderland_\n(2010)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland \\(2010\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass) § Tim Burton's Alice in\nWonderland (2010)](/wiki/Red_Queen_\\(Through_the_Looking-\nGlass\\)#Tim_Burton.27s_Alice_in_Wonderland_.282010.29 \"Red Queen \\(Through the\nLooking-Glass\\)\")\n\n### _American McGee 's\nAlice_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: American McGee's Alice\")]\n\nIn the video game _[American McGee's Alice](/wiki/American_McGee%27s_Alice\n\"American McGee's Alice\")_, the Queen of Hearts is the final boss and the\nreason for Wonderland's decay. When Alice fights her, she discovers that the\nQueen is her dark side – an embodiment of her insanity; the Queen must be\ndestroyed for Alice to become sane once more. The Queen's appearance is\ndifferent in _American McGee 's Alice_ from how she is in the book: she\nappears first as a faceless entity having tentacles for arms, legs, and hair.\nIt is later revealed that this is a mere puppet and that the true Queen of\nHearts is a horrible monster in the image of a real anatomical heart. She is\ncalled both the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen interchangeably throughout\nthe game. No mention is made of the Red Queen from \"Through the Looking\nGlass.\" However, the White Queen is seen for only a moment, as her head is\nchopped off by the enemy in The Pale Realm. It's implied that after Alice was\nplaced in the asylum the red queen and the queen of hearts fused together\nwhich explains why the Queen of Hearts is able to control the red piece and\nthe cards at the same time.\n\nIn the sequel, _[Alice: Madness Returns](/wiki/Alice:_Madness_Returns \"Alice:\nMadness Returns\")_ , the Queen of Hearts is sought by Alice for assistance in\nstopping an Infernal Train from tearing apart Wonderland and driving her back\ninto insanity. The Queen claims, when found in the ruins of the Red Kingdom,\nthat Alice is being manipulated by someone other than herself, that this\nperson is trying to erase her memories, particularly about the fire in her\nchildhood, which are tearing her sanity apart. It later turns out that this\nperson is none other than her psychiatrist Dr. Angus Bumby, who has been\nrevealed to having raped Alice's older sister Lizzy and burned down the house\nwith Lizzy and Alice's parents to cover up the crime, and that he is\nattempting to erase Alice's memories and subject her to prostitution after it.\nIn this sequel, the Red Queen has changed considerably, taking the appearance\nof a younger Alice, only in a royal dress befitting the Queen of Hearts, with\nlarge fleshy claws rather than hands, and her lower body composed of fleshy\ntentacles that spread throughout the entire castle, which is actually the\nQueen's body itself. Some argue she is actually based not on Alice herself,\nbut her sister, as she also referred to her as \"Lizzy\" in a following\ndialogue, and considering she felt guilty of the death of her family, its\npossible her subconscious projected her dead sister in the queen she herself\nkilled in the previous game.\n\n### The Looking-Glass\nWars[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: The Looking-Glass Wars\")]\n\nIn _[The Looking Glass Wars](/wiki/The_Looking_Glass_Wars \"The Looking Glass\nWars\")_ by Frank Beddor, the ruling dynasty of the Wonderland is the Heart\nfamily. The title of Queen of Hearts is a hereditary title for the Queen of\nWonderland. The Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland is reimagined as\n[Queen Redd](/wiki/Queen_Redd \"Queen Redd\"), the enemy and aunt of the\nheroine, Alyss. She kills Alyss's parents and [usurps](/wiki/Usurper\n\"Usurper\") the throne of Wonderland.\n\nIt should be noted that the true Queen of Hearts in this story is Genevieve\nHeart, Alyss's mother as an apparent re-imagining of the [White\nQueen](/wiki/White_Queen_\\(Through_the_Looking_Glass\\) \"White Queen \\(Through\nthe Looking Glass\\)\"). Alyss is, therefore, the Princess of Hearts.\n\n### Alice in the Country of\nHearts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Alice in the Country of Hearts\")]\n\nIn the manga [Alice in the Country of\nHearts](/wiki/Alice_in_the_Country_of_Hearts \"Alice in the Country of\nHearts\"), the Queen of Hearts is known as Vivaldi. She isn't as much a main\ncharacter, though, and she has very few parts in the current books. Vivaldi\nrules Heart Castle and is feuding with the other territories over\n[Wonderland](/wiki/Wonderland_\\(fictional_country\\) \"Wonderland \\(fictional\ncountry\\)\"). She is beautiful with black hair, unlike other adaptations. She\nspeaks in the [majestic plural](/wiki/Majestic_plural \"Majestic plural\"), I.E,\n\"We are happy you are here to see us.\" As discovered through Heart no Kuni no\nAlice the game by Quinrose (the predecessor to the manga) Blood Dupree (The\nHatter) is Vivaldi's little brother though it is alluded to be a romantic\ninterest for Vivaldi until Alice discovers the secret.\n\n### SyFy TV\nminiseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: SyFy TV miniseries\")]\n\nIn the two-part series _[Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(TV_miniseries\\) \"Alice \\(TV\nminiseries\\)\")_ , hosted by the SyFy Channel, the Queen of Hearts is portrayed\nby [Kathy Bates](/wiki/Kathy_Bates \"Kathy Bates\") as a refined but ruthless\ndrug lord. The miniseries is set one hundred and fifty years after the\noriginal Alice's first visit to Wonderland (the heroine is an unrelated\ncharacter) and the Queen is (as usual) the primary villain of the series. As\nis customary, the Queen is depicted as [narcissistic](/wiki/Narcissistic\n\"Narcissistic\"), declaring herself as \"the most powerful woman in the history\nof literature\" and [obese](/wiki/Obese \"Obese\"). Her calm, cold demeanour\nsuggests that she too is a mixture of the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen.\nHer name is given as \"Mary Elizabeth Heart\", and it is suggested that the\nHearts are the \"Red\" royal family who seized control of Wonderland from the\n\"White\" royal family.\n\n### Once Upon a\nTime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Once Upon a Time\")]\n\n  * The Queen of Hearts appears in the _[Once Upon a Time](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_series\\) \"Once Upon a Time \\(TV series\\)\")_ episode .\"[Hat Trick](/wiki/Hat_Trick_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Hat Trick \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\", played by Jennifer Koenig.

In her earlier life, Cora (portrayed by [Rose McGowan](/wiki/Rose_McGowan \"Rose McGowan\")) was also the miller's daughter (the heroine of the _[Rumpelstiltskin](/wiki/Rumpelstiltskin \"Rumpelstiltskin\")_ story). She appears in every season throughout the show most often portrayed by [Barbara Hershey](/wiki/Barbara_Hershey \"Barbara Hershey\") but at younger age portrayed by [Rose McGowan](/wiki/Rose_McGowan \"Rose McGowan\"). She was the main antagonist of Season 2.\n  * In the show's spin-off, _[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Wonderland \"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland\")_ , a flashback reveals that Cora (as the Queen of Hearts) was the [Red Queen's](/wiki/Red_Queen_\\(Through_the_Looking-Glass\\)#Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Wonderland \"Red Queen \\(Through the Looking-Glass\\)\") tutor in magic; Cora apparently ruled part of Wonderland and was a political rival of the Red King.\n\n### Other versions and\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Other versions and adaptations\")]\n\n  * In various film and television versions of the novel,[3] The Queen has been played by [May Robson](/wiki/May_Robson \"May Robson\"), [Ronald Lang](/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Lang&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ronald Lang \\(page does not exist\\)\"), [Zsa Zsa Gabor](/wiki/Zsa_Zsa_Gabor \"Zsa Zsa Gabor\"), [Eve Arden](/wiki/Eve_Arden \"Eve Arden\"), [Jayne Meadows](/wiki/Jayne_Meadows \"Jayne Meadows\"), and, In the 1999 _[Alice in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(1999_film\\) \"Alice in Wonderland \\(1999 film\\)\")_ television movie, [Miranda Richardson](/wiki/Miranda_Richardson \"Miranda Richardson\"), whose portrayal is strongly reminiscent of her role as the spoiled [Queenie](/wiki/Queenie_\\(Blackadder\\) \"Queenie \\(Blackadder\\)\") in _[Blackadder](/wiki/Blackadder \"Blackadder\")_.\n  * In an episode of _[Wizards of Waverly Place](/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place \"Wizards of Waverly Place\")_ parodying the novel, Alex Russo is in court and becomes smart with the Queen of Hearts (played by Theresa Russo).\n  * In the 1991 Disney channel series _[Adventures in Wonderland](/wiki/Adventures_in_Wonderland \"Adventures in Wonderland\")_ , the Queen was played by [Armelia McQueen](/wiki/Armelia_McQueen \"Armelia McQueen\"). She appears as a short-tempered and childish but basically benevolent ruler. She was alternately called \"The Queen of Hearts\" and \"The Red Queen\" during the course of the series.\n  * In [Sandra the Fairytale Detective](/wiki/Sandra_the_Fairytale_Detective \"Sandra the Fairytale Detective\"), her name is Theressa.\n  * [Pandora Hearts](/wiki/Pandora_Hearts \"Pandora Hearts\") has Miranda Barma who would later become the chain Demios the Executor also nicknamed Queen of Hearts and they have a similar obsession of cutting heads.\n  * The Queen is one of the characters adopted by [Gwen Stefani](/wiki/Gwen_Stefani \"Gwen Stefani\") in her [Wonderland](/wiki/Wonderland_\\(fictional_country\\) \"Wonderland \\(fictional country\\)\")-themed music video [What You Waiting For?](/wiki/What_You_Waiting_For%3F \"What You Waiting For?\"). She wears a red gown and a crown reminiscent of the [Imperial State Crown](/wiki/Imperial_State_Crown \"Imperial State Crown\") from the [British Crown Jewels](/wiki/British_Crown_Jewels \"British Crown Jewels\"). The Queen wanders through a garden populated with [flamingos](/wiki/Flamingo \"Flamingo\") and pushes Alice (also Stefani) into a pool of her own tears.\n  * The Queen of Hearts features in [Unsuk Chin](/wiki/Unsuk_Chin \"Unsuk Chin\")'s 2007 opera _[Alice in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(opera\\) \"Alice in Wonderland \\(opera\\)\")_ ; the role was created for [Dame Gwyneth Jones](/wiki/Gwyneth_Jones_\\(soprano\\) \"Gwyneth Jones \\(soprano\\)\").\n  * The Queen is a major character in [Christopher Wheeldon](/wiki/Christopher_Wheeldon \"Christopher Wheeldon\")'s 2011 full-length ballet _[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_\\(ballet\\) \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland \\(ballet\\)\")_, created for [The Royal Ballet](/wiki/The_Royal_Ballet \"The Royal Ballet\"). The role was created for principal dancer [Zenaida Yanowsky](/wiki/Zenaida_Yanowsky \"Zenaida Yanowsky\")[4] and includes a hilarious spoof of the Rose Adagio from _[The Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_\\(ballet\\) \"The Sleeping Beauty \\(ballet\\)\")_.\n  * The Queen appeared briefly during the [2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony](/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony \"2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\") in London in a segment dedicated to the villains of British children's literature.\n  * In [Marissa Meyer](/wiki/Marissa_Meyer \"Marissa Meyer\")'s 2016 novel _Heartless_ , the backstory of the Queen of Hearts is told, in which she is a young girl who aspires to be a baker, but is instead taken off course by the anticipated proposal of the King of Hearts.[5]\n  * The Queen of Hearts appears in the twelfth episode (\"And the Broken Staff\") of _[The Librarians](/wiki/The_Librarians_\\(2014_TV_series\\) \"The Librarians \\(2014 TV series\\)\")_. She is brought to life by the wizard [Prospero](/wiki/Prospero \"Prospero\") as a distraction for the Librarians, but is subsequently tricked into attacking her own reflection, turning her into a pack of cards (mirroring the ending of the original story).\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queen_of_Hearts_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Jenkins, p.759\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Gardner, Martin](/wiki/Martin_Gardner \"Martin Gardner\"); Lewis Carroll (1998). _[The Annotated Alice](/wiki/The_Annotated_Alice \"The Annotated Alice\")_.
