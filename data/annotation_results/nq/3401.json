It was first published in\n1900 under the supervision of Capt. P. R. Gordon, ISC and [Hemchandra\nGoswami](/wiki/Hemchandra_Goswami \"Hemchandra Goswami\"), 33 years after the\npublication of Bronson’s dictionary. It contained about 22,346 words. This\ndictionary still published by _Hemkosh Printers_ is considered to be the\n\"standard\" reference of the Assamese language.[1]\n\nHemkosh is the second dictionary of Assamese language. The first Assamese\ndictionary was compiled by Dr. [Miles Bronson](/wiki/Miles_Bronson \"Miles\nBronson\"), an American Baptist Missionary. His dictionary, published in 1867\nat the American Baptist Mission Press, [Sibsagar](/wiki/Sibsagar \"Sibsagar\"),\nis out of print. Bronson’s work did not pretend to be an etymological\ndictionary but contained a very considerable collection of words from the\npeople themselves without recording derivations.[1]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hemkosh&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [RCILTS, IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/rcilts/dictionary.html) An English-Assamese-Bodo Trilingual Dictionary \n\n![](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1)\n\nRetrieved from\n\"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hemkosh&oldid=839114429](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hemkosh&oldid=839114429)\"\n\n[Categories](/wiki/Help:Category \"Help:Category\"):\n\n  * [Assamese language](/wiki/Category:Assamese_language \"Category:Assamese language\")\n  * [Books from Assam](/wiki/Category:Books_from_Assam \"Category:Books from Assam\")\n  * [Assamese-language books](/wiki/Category:Assamese-language_books \"Category:Assamese-language books\")\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * [Articles lacking in-text citations from December 2012](/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_December_2012 \"Category:Articles lacking in-text citations from December 2012\")\n  * [All articles lacking in-text citations](/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations \"Category:All articles lacking in-text citations\")\n  * [Books with missing cover](/wiki/Category:Books_with_missing_cover \"Category:Books with missing cover\")\n  * [Articles containing Assamese-language text](/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Assamese-language_text \"Category:Articles containing Assamese-language text\")\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Personal tools\n\n  * Not logged in\n  * [Talk](/wiki/Special:MyTalk \"Discussion about edits from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-n\\]\")\n  * [Contributions](/wiki/Special:MyContributions \"A list of edits made from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-y\\]\")\n  * [Create account](/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Hemkosh \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in;
