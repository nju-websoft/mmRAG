Her father Upendranath Ganguly hailed\nfrom [Barisal district](/wiki/Barisal_district \"Barisal district\") of Eastern\n[Bengal](/wiki/Bengal \"Bengal\") (now [Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh\n\"Bangladesh\")) but settled in the United Province. He was a restaurant owner.\nHer mother Ambalika Devi was the daughter of [Trailokyanath\nSanyal](/wiki/Trailokyanath_Sanyal \"Trailokyanath Sanyal\"), a renowned Brahmo\nleader who wrote many Brahmo hymns. Upendranath Ganguly's younger brother\n[Dhirendranath Ganguly](/wiki/Dhirendranath_Ganguly \"Dhirendranath Ganguly\")\n(D G) was one of the earliest film directors.[1] Another brother,\nNagendranath, was a university professor who married [Nobel Prize\nwinner](/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature \"Nobel Prize in Literature\")\n[Rabindranath Tagore](/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore \"Rabindranath Tagore\")'s only\nsurviving daughter Mira Devi.[2] Aruna's sister [Purnima\nBanerjee](/wiki/Purnima_Banerjee \"Purnima Banerjee\") was a member of the\n[Constituent Assembly of India](/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_India\n\"Constituent Assembly of India\").\n\nAruna was educated at Sacred Heart Convent in [Lahore](/wiki/Lahore \"Lahore\")\nand then at [All Saints' College](http://www.allsaintscollege.org/) in\n[Nainital](/wiki/Nainital \"Nainital\").

She was arrested on the charge that she was a\n[vagrant](/wiki/Vagrancy_\\(people\\) \"Vagrancy \\(people\\)\") and hence not\nreleased in 1931 under the [Gandhi-Irwin Pact](/wiki/Gandhi-Irwin_Pact\n\"Gandhi-Irwin Pact\") which stipulated release of all political prisoners.\nOther women co-prisoners refused to leave the premises unless she was also\nreleased and gave in only after [Mohandas K. Gandhi](/wiki/Mohandas_K._Gandhi\n\"Mohandas K. Gandhi\") intervened. A public agitation secured her release.\n\nIn 1932, she was held [prisoner](/wiki/Political_prisoner \"Political\nprisoner\") at the Tihar Jail where she protested the indifferent treatment of\npolitical prisoners by launching a hunger strike. Her efforts resulted in an\nimprovement of conditions in the Tihar Jail but she was moved to\n[Ambala](/wiki/Ambala \"Ambala\") and was subjected to solitary confinement. She\nwas politically not very active after her release, but at the ending of 1942,\nshe took part in the underground movement. She was active in it.\n\n## Face of Quit India\nmovement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aruna_Asaf_Ali&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Face of Quit India movement\")]\n\nOn 8 August 1942, the [All India Congress\nCommittee](/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee \"All India Congress Committee\")\npassed the [Quit India resolution](/wiki/Quit_India_Movement \"Quit India\nMovement\") at the [Bombay](/wiki/Bombay \"Bombay\") session. The government\nresponded by arresting the major leaders and all members of the [Congress\nWorking Committee](/wiki/Congress_Working_Committee \"Congress Working\nCommittee\") and thus tried to pre-empt the movement from success. Young Aruna\nAsaf Ali presided over the remainder of the session on 9 August and hoisted\nthe Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. This marked the commencement of\nthe movement. The police fired upon the assembly at the session. Aruna was\ndubbed the _Heroine of the 1942 movement_ for her bravery in the face of\ndanger and was called _Grand Old Lady of the Independence movement_ in her\nlater years. Despite the absence of direct leadership, spontaneous protests\nand demonstrations were held all over the country, as an expression of the\ndesire of India’s youth to achieve independence.\n\n## Countdown to\nIndependence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aruna_Asaf_Ali&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Countdown to Independence\")]\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued in her name but she went underground to evade the\narrest and started an underground movement in the year 1942. Her property was\nseized and sold. In the meanwhile, she also edited _Inquilab_ , a monthly\nmagazine of the Congress Party, along with [Ram Manohar\nLohia](/wiki/Ram_Manohar_Lohia \"Ram Manohar Lohia\"). In a 1944 issue, she\nexhorted youth to action by asking them to forget futile discussions about\nviolence and [non-violence](/wiki/Non-violence \"Non-violence\") and join the\nrevolution. Leaders such as [Jayaprakash Narayan](/wiki/Jayaprakash_Narayan\n\"Jayaprakash Narayan\") and Aruna Asaf Ali were described as \"the Political\nchildren of Gandhi but recent students of [Karl Marx](/wiki/Karl_Marx \"Karl\nMarx\").\" The government announced a reward of 5,000 [rupees](/wiki/Rupees\n\"Rupees\") for her capture. She fell ill and was for a period hiding in Dr.\nJoshi's Hospital in Karol Bagh in Delhi. Mahatma Gandhi sent her a hand-\nwritten note to her to come out of hiding and surrender herself – as her\nmission was accomplished and as she could utilize the reward amount for the\n[Harijan](/wiki/Harijan \"Harijan\") cause. However, she came out of hiding only\nafter the warrant against her was withdrawn in 1946. She treasured the note\nfrom the Mahatma and it adorned her drawing room. However, she also faced\ncriticism from Gandhi for her support of the [Royal Indian Navy\nMutiny](/wiki/Royal_Indian_Navy_Mutiny \"Royal Indian Navy Mutiny\"), a movement\nshe saw as the single greatest unifying factor of Hindus and Muslims at a time\nthat was the peak of the movement for Pakistan.\n\n## Post-\nIndependence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aruna_Asaf_Ali&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Post-Independence\")]\n\nShe was a member of the [Congress Socialist\nParty](/wiki/Congress_Socialist_Party \"Congress Socialist Party\"), a\n[caucus](/wiki/Caucus \"Caucus\") within the [Congress\nParty](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress \"Indian National Congress\") for\nactivists with [socialist](/wiki/Socialist \"Socialist\") leanings.\nDisillusioned with the progress of the Congress Party on socialism she joined\na new party, [Socialist Party](/wiki/Socialist_Party_\\(India\\) \"Socialist\nParty \\(India\\)\") in 1948. She, however, left that party along with [Edatata\nNarayanan](/wiki/Edatata_Narayanan \"Edatata Narayanan\") and they visited\n[Moscow](/wiki/Moscow \"Moscow\") along with [Rajani Palme\nDutt](/wiki/Rajani_Palme_Dutt \"Rajani Palme Dutt\"). Both of them joined the\n[Communist Party of India](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India \"Communist Party of\nIndia\") in the early 1950s. On the personal front, she was bereaved when Asaf\nAli died in 1953.\n\nIn 1954, she helped form the [National Federation of Indian\nWomen](/wiki/National_Federation_of_Indian_Women \"National Federation of\nIndian Women\"), the women's wing of CPI but left the party in 1956 following\n[Nikita Khrushchev](/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev \"Nikita Khrushchev\")'s disowning\nof Stalin. In 1958, she was elected the first [Mayor](/wiki/Mayor \"Mayor\") of\n[Delhi](/wiki/Delhi \"Delhi\"). She was closely associated with social activists\nand secularists of her era like Krishna Menon, Vimla Kapoor, [Guru Radha\nKishan](/wiki/Guru_Radha_Kishan \"Guru Radha Kishan\"), Premsagar Gupta, Rajani\nPalme Joti, Sarla Sharma and Subhadra Joshi for social welfare and development\nin Delhi.\n\nShe and Narayanan started Link publishing house and published a daily\nnewspaper, _Patriot_ and a weekly, _Link_ the same year.

Later she moved out of the\npublishing house due to internal politics, stunned by greed taking over the\ncreed of her comrades. In 1964, she rejoined the Congress Party but stopped\ntaking part in active politics. Despite reservations about the\n[emergency](/wiki/Indian_Emergency \"Indian Emergency\"), she remained close to\n[Indira Gandhi](/wiki/Indira_Gandhi \"Indira Gandhi\") and [Rajiv\nGandhi](/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi \"Rajiv Gandhi\").\n\nShe died in [New Delhi](/wiki/New_Delhi \"New Delhi\") on 29 July 1996, aged\n87.[5]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aruna_Asaf_Ali&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Legacy\")]\n\nAruna Asaf Ali was awarded [International Lenin Peace\nPrize](/wiki/International_Lenin_Peace_Prize \"International Lenin Peace\nPrize\") for the year 1964[6] and the [Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International\nUnderstanding](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_Award_for_International_Understanding\n\"Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding\") in 1991.[7] She was\nawarded India’s second highest civilian honour, the [Padma\nVibhushan](/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan \"Padma Vibhushan\") in her lifetime in 1992,\nand finally the highest civilian award, the [Bharat Ratna](/wiki/Bharat_Ratna\n\"Bharat Ratna\"), [posthumously](/wiki/Posthumous_recognition \"Posthumous\nrecognition\") in 1997.[8] In 1998, a stamp commemorating her was issued.\n_Aruna Asaf Ali marg_ in [New Delhi](/wiki/New_Delhi \"New Delhi\") was named in\nher honour.
