It\nwas manufactured at the [Spring Hill](/wiki/Spring_Hill,_Tennessee \"Spring\nHill, Tennessee\") GM plant. Its unibody platform is shared with the [Chevrolet\nEquinox](/wiki/Chevrolet_Equinox \"Chevrolet Equinox\"), [Pontiac\nTorrent](/wiki/Pontiac_Torrent \"Pontiac Torrent\") and the\n[European](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") [Opel Antara](/wiki/Opel_Antara \"Opel\nAntara\").

The four-cylinder Vue\nwas available with the [VTi](/wiki/VTi_transmission \"VTi transmission\")\n[continuously variable transmission](/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission\n\"Continuously variable transmission\") (CVT) until GM canceled it for 2005 due\nto dependability issues.\n\nThe VUE received a facelift for the 2006 model year. Upgrades included a\nredesigned interior with higher-quality materials, a new bumper and grille,\nand some minor cosmetic pieces to the exterior. [OnStar](/wiki/OnStar\n\"OnStar\") is now standard as well as [cruise control](/wiki/Cruise_control\n\"Cruise control\") and automatic headlights. However, GM badges were not added\nto the side of the vehicle until GM took over production from Saturn for the\nsecond generation VUE.\n\n### Model year\nchanges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Saturn_Vue&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Model year changes\")]\n\nIn 2004:\n\n  * The VUE Red Line was released\n  * V6 models received Honda's J35A3 engine and Honda transmission. This 3.5 liter engine and 5 speed transmission boosted performance over the prior V-6. It was an important selling point at the time. This V-6 engine was used in the Saturn VUE's 2004 to 2007 model years.\n\nIn 2005:\n\n  * 5- and 4-speed automatic transmissions return for 2005, and the CVT is dropped.\n  * All VUE's get a redesigned interior critique with new air vents, new steering wheel, and a new radio faceplate which contributes [noise, vibration, and harshness](/wiki/Noise,_vibration,_and_harshness \"Noise, vibration, and harshness\").\n\nIn 2006:\n\n  * Facelift with new interior, cosmetic changes to the exterior.\n\n### Red Line[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Saturn_Vue&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Red Line\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Saturn_Vue_RedLine_--\n_10-31-2009.jpg/220px-Saturn_Vue_RedLine_--\n_10-31-2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Saturn_Vue_RedLine_--_10-31-2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Saturn_Vue_RedLine_--_10-31-2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2004–2005 Saturn Vue Red Line\n\nSaturn introduced a special high-performance line of vehicles in 2004 under\nthe name, \"Red Line\". The **VUE Red Line** includes the same 250 hp (186 kW)\n[Honda](/wiki/Honda \"Honda\") _[J35A3](/wiki/Honda_J_engine \"Honda J engine\")_\nV6 as the regular model, but with sportier suspension tuning, lowered 1 inch,\nand unique power steering calibration for performance, 18 in alloy wheels,\nground-effect front and rear bumpers, unique rocker panel trim, chrome exhaust\ntip, special black leather and suede seats (optional for 2005, standard for\n2006 and 2007), footwell lighting (included with leather and suede seats\npackage, not available with optional full-leather (heated front) seats), and a\nspecial gauge cluster complete the visual updates. It also includes some\nspecial interior features as well, such as a higher quality audio system.[1]\n\n### Green Line[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Saturn_Vue&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Green Line\")]\n\nThe high-performance VUE Red Line was joined for 2007 by an environmentally\noriented **Green Line** model. The Vue is a [mild hybrid](/wiki/Mild_hybrid\n\"Mild hybrid\"), or \"assist hybrid\", using what GM calls a \"[belt alternator\nstarter](/wiki/Belt_alternator_starter \"Belt alternator starter\")\" [BAS\nHybrid](/wiki/BAS_Hybrid \"BAS Hybrid\") system.[2] A large electric motor is\nconnected to the crankshaft via a special accessory drive belt, with a\nmodified automatic transmission fitted.\n\nIt automatically stops the engine when the vehicle comes to a halt and\ninstantly restarts it when the vehicle must move again. Not to be confused as\njust a \"start-stop\" system, the electric motor also assists somewhat during\ninitial launch, during torque smoothing and when under heavy acceleration. A\n36-volt [nickel metal hydride](/wiki/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery \"Nickel\nmetal hydride battery\") (NiMH) battery pack, located under the load floor,\npowers the motor/generator unit and also stores regenerative braking energy.\nThe regenerative charging and electric motor assist functions are shown to the\ndriver via an analog gauge on the dash board, and real-time fuel-economy\nfeedback is accomplished via an \"eco\" light that glows when the instantaneous\nfuel economy is beating the window sticker fuel economy values.\n\nThe fuel savings are 20 percent up from the base vehicle's 22 mpg‑US (11 L/100\nkm)/27 mpg‑US (8.7 L/100 km) city/highway EPA sticker to 27 mpg‑US (8.7 L/100\nkm)/32 mpg‑US (7.4 L/100 km), the highest highway fuel economy of any 2007\nmodel SUV sold in the US market.[3] In Canada, according to Saturn, the Vue\ngets an estimated 8.8 L/100 km (32 mpg‑imp; 27 mpg‑US) city and 6.7 L/100 km\n(42 mpg‑imp; 35 mpg‑US) highway.[4]\n\nThe Green Line has a 170 hp (127 kW) 2.4-liter\n_[Ecotec](/wiki/GM_Ecotec_engine \"GM Ecotec engine\")_ [DOHC](/wiki/DOHC\n\"DOHC\")-phaser engine which replaces the standard 144-horsepower (107 kW)\n2.2-liter inline-four engine, resulting in the improvement of 0–60 mph (0–97\nkm/h) acceleration time by 1.0 second. Pricing for the hybrid is about\nUS$2,000 more than a similarly equipped Vue, and debuted in production form on\nJanuary 8, 2006 at the [North American International Auto\nShow](/wiki/North_American_International_Auto_Show \"North American\nInternational Auto Show\") in [Detroit](/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\"). The Green\nLine went on sale in the third quarter of 2006.\n\n### Engines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Saturn_Vue&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Engines\")]\n\nYears  | Engine  | Power  | Torque   \n---|---|---|---  \n2002–2007 | 2.2 [L](/wiki/Liter \"Liter\") _[Ecotec L61](/wiki/GM_Ecotec_engine#L61 \"GM Ecotec engine\")_ [I4](/wiki/Inline-four_engine \"Inline-four engine\") | 143 [hp](/wiki/Horsepower \"Horsepower\") (107 [kW](/wiki/Kilowatt \"Kilowatt\")) | 152 [lb·ft](/wiki/Foot_pound_force \"Foot pound force\") (206 [N·m](/wiki/Newton_metre \"Newton metre\"))   \n2002–2003 | 3.0 L _[54-Degree](/wiki/GM_54-Degree_V6_engine \"GM 54-Degree V6 engine\")_ [V6](/wiki/V6 \"V6\") | 181 hp (135 kW) | 195 lb·ft (264 N·m)   \n2004–2007 | 3.5 L _[GM L66](/wiki/GM_L66_engine \"GM L66 engine\")_ _([J35A3](/wiki/Honda_J_engine \"Honda J engine\"))_ [V6](/wiki/V6 \"V6\") | 250 hp (186 kW) | 242 lb·ft (328 N·m)   \n2007-2010 | 2.4 L _[Ecotec LE5](/wiki/GM_Ecotec_engine#LE5 \"GM Ecotec engine\")_ [I4](/wiki/Inline-four_engine \"Inline-four engine\") | 170 hp (127 kW) | 163 lb·ft (220 N·m)   \n2008-2010 | 3.6 L _[LY7](/wiki/GM_High_Feature_engine#LY7 \"GM High Feature engine\")_ [V6](/wiki/V6 \"V6\") | 257 hp (192 kW) | 248 lb·ft (336 N·m)   \n  \n### Safety[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Saturn_Vue&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Safety\")]\n\nIn [Insurance Institute for Highway\nSafety](/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety \"Insurance Institute for\nHighway Safety\") (IIHS) crash tests the Vue receives a _Good_ overall rating\nin the frontal offset crash test.
