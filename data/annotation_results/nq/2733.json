Multiple\nplayers usually score double-digit points in any given basketball game; the\ndouble nomenclature is usually reserved for when a player has double-digit\ntotals in more than one category.\n\nA **double-double** is the accumulation of a double-digit number total in two\nof the statistical five categories in a game. The most common double-double\ncombination is points-rebounds, followed by points-assists. Since the\n[1983–84](/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NBA_season \"1983–84 NBA season\") season, [Tim\nDuncan](/wiki/Tim_Duncan \"Tim Duncan\") leads the [National Basketball\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National Basketball\nAssociation\") (NBA) in the points-rebounds combination with 840, and [John\nStockton](/wiki/John_Stockton \"John Stockton\") leads the points-assists\ncombination with 714.\n\nA **triple-double** is the accumulation of a double-digit number total in\nthree of the five categories in a game. The most common way to achieve a\ntriple-double is through points, rebounds, and assists. [Oscar\nRobertson](/wiki/Oscar_Robertson \"Oscar Robertson\") leads the all-time NBA\nlist with 181 career triple-doubles and is, with [Russell\nWestbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\"), one of only two\nplayers ever to average a triple-double for a season. Westbrook currently\nholds the record for most triple-doubles in a season with 42.\n\nA **quadruple-double** is the accumulation of a double-digit number total in\nfour of the five categories in a game. This has occurred four times in the\nNBA.\n\nA **quintuple-double** is the accumulation of a double-digit number total in\nall five categories in a game. Two quintuple-doubles have been recorded at the\nhigh school level, by [Tamika Catchings](/wiki/Tamika_Catchings \"Tamika\nCatchings\") and Aimee Oertner, but none have occurred in a college or\nprofessional game.[1] A similar accomplishment is the **five-by-five** , which\nis the accumulation of at least five points, five rebounds, five assists, five\nsteals, and five blocks in a game. In the NBA, only [Hakeem\nOlajuwon](/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon \"Hakeem Olajuwon\") and [Andrei\nKirilenko](/wiki/Andrei_Kirilenko \"Andrei Kirilenko\") have accumulated\nmultiple five-by-fives since the [1984–85](/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_NBA_season\n\"1984–85 NBA season\") season.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Double-double\n    * 1.1 NBA\n      * 1.1.1 Double-double leaders (in regular season)\n      * 1.1.2 Facts\n  * 2 Triple-double\n    * 2.1 NBA\n      * 2.1.1 Triple-double leaders\n      * 2.1.2 Facts\n    * 2.2 NCAA Division I\n  * 3 Quadruple-double\n    * 3.1 NBA\n    * 3.2 Other men's basketball\n    * 3.3 Women's basketball\n  * 4 Quintuple-double\n  * 5 Five-by-five\n    * 5.1 NBA\n    * 5.2 Facts\n  * 6 References\n\n## Double-\ndouble[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Double-double\")]\n\n\"Double-double\" redirects here.

The most\ncommon double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points\nand assists.[2] Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the\n2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main\nstatistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the\nseason.[3]\n\nSpecial double-doubles are rare. One such double-double is called **double\ndouble-double** (also referred to as **20–20** or **Double-20**). It occurs\nwhen a player accumulates 20 or more in two different statistical categories\nin a game.[4][5][6] Another such double-double is called a **triple double-\ndouble** (also referred to as **30–30**).[7] The only player in NBA history to\nrecord a 40-40 is [Wilt Chamberlain](/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain \"Wilt\nChamberlain\"), who achieved the feat eight times in his career. Of the five\ninstances, four were recorded in his rookie season, and the fifth was achieved\nthe following year where he recorded 78 points and 43 rebounds in a game.\n\n### NBA[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: NBA\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Karl_Malone_in_Afghanistan.jpg/145px-\nKarl_Malone_in_Afghanistan.jpg)](/wiki/File:Karl_Malone_in_Afghanistan.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/John_Stockton.jpg/155px-\nJohn_Stockton.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Stockton.jpg)\n\n[Karl Malone](/wiki/Karl_Malone \"Karl Malone\") (left) and [John\nStockton](/wiki/John_Stockton \"John Stockton\") (right) were once teammates on\nthe [Utah Jazz](/wiki/Utah_Jazz \"Utah Jazz\") in the 1990s.

The most\ncommon way for a player to achieve a triple-double is with points, rebounds,\nand assists, though on occasion players may record 10 or more steals or\nblocked shots in a game.[12] The origin of the term \"triple-double\" is\nunclear. Some sources claim that it was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers\npublic relations director Bruce Jolesch in the 1980s in order to showcase\n[Magic Johnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic Johnson\")'s versatility,[13][14]\nwhile others claim that it was coined by then [Philadelphia\n76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia 76ers\") media relations director\n[Harvey Pollack](/wiki/Harvey_Pollack \"Harvey Pollack\") in 1980.[15][16] The\ntriple-double became an officially recorded statistic during the [1979–80\nseason](/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_NBA_season \"1979–80 NBA season\").\n\nThere has been occasional controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a\nplayer achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds in a\ngame have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot late in the\ngame in order to recover the rebound; a few have even gone so far as shooting\noff their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this,\nNBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a\nlegitimate scoring attempt.[17]\n\n### NBA[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: NBA\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Russell_Westbrook.jpg/220px-\nRussell_Westbrook.jpg)](/wiki/File:Russell_Westbrook.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Russell_Westbrook.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Russell Westbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\") is the only\nplayer to have recorded a perfect triple double (no missed shots and no missed\nfree throws) in NBA history[18]\n\nFrom the [1990–91](/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_NBA_season \"1990–91 NBA season\") to\nthe [2010–11 season](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_NBA_season \"2010–11 NBA season\"),\nthe NBA averaged 34.5 triple-doubles per season, roughly 1 in every 36\ngames.[19]\n\nFrom the [2011–12](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_NBA_season \"2011–12 NBA season\") to\nthe [2016–17 season](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NBA_season \"2016–17 NBA season\"),\nthe NBA saw a dramatic increase in the number of triple-doubles, with an\naverage of 57.33 triple-doubles per season, roughly 1 in every 22 games.[20]\n[Russell Westbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\") was\nresponsible for 74 of the triple-doubles during that span, or 21.5% of the 344\ntotal triple-doubles.\n\nSince the [1983–84](/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NBA_season \"1983–84 NBA season\")\nseason, 25 triple-doubles have been recorded by players coming off the bench;\n[Detlef Schrempf](/wiki/Detlef_Schrempf \"Detlef Schrempf\") recorded three with\nthe [Indiana Pacers](/wiki/Indiana_Pacers \"Indiana Pacers\").[21][22]\n\n#### Triple-double\nleaders[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Triple-double leaders\")]\n\nThe following is a list of regular season triple-double leaders:\n\nAll-time triple-double leaders Rank | Name | Triple-doubles  \n---|---|---  \n1 | Robertson, Oscar[Oscar Robertson](/wiki/Oscar_Robertson \"Oscar Robertson\")* | 181[23]  \n2 | Johnson, Magic[Magic Johnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic Johnson\")* | 138[23]  \n3 | Kidd, Jason[Jason Kidd](/wiki/Jason_Kidd \"Jason Kidd\") | 107[24][25]  \n4 | Westbrook, Russell[Russell Westbrook](/wiki/Russell_Westbrook \"Russell Westbrook\")^ | 104[26]  \n5 | Chamberlain, Wilt[Wilt Chamberlain](/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain \"Wilt Chamberlain\")* | 78[23]  \n6 | James, LeBron[LeBron James](/wiki/LeBron_James \"LeBron James\")^ | 73[23]  \n7 | Bird, Larry[Larry Bird](/wiki/Larry_Bird \"Larry Bird\")* | 59[27]  \n8 | Lever, Fat[Fat Lever](/wiki/Fat_Lever \"Fat Lever\") | 43[23]  \n9 | Harden, James[James Harden](/wiki/James_Harden \"James Harden\")^ | 35[28]  \n10 | Cousy, Bob[Bob Cousy](/wiki/Bob_Cousy \"Bob Cousy\")* | 33[29]  \n11 | Havlicek, John[John Havlicek](/wiki/John_Havlicek \"John Havlicek\")* | 31[30]  \nRondo, Rajon[Rajon Rondo](/wiki/Rajon_Rondo \"Rajon Rondo\")^ | 31[31]  \n13 | Hill, Grant[Grant Hill](/wiki/Grant_Hill \"Grant Hill\") | 29[32]  \n14 | Jordan, Michael[Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\")* | 28[23]  \n15 | Baylor, Elgin[Elgin Baylor](/wiki/Elgin_Baylor \"Elgin Baylor\")* | 26[33]  \n16 | Drexler, Clyde[Clyde Drexler](/wiki/Clyde_Drexler \"Clyde Drexler\")* | 25[23]  \n17 | Frazier, Walt[Walt Frazier](/wiki/Walt_Frazier \"Walt Frazier\")* | 23[34]  \n18 | Green, Draymond[Draymond Green](/wiki/Draymond_Green \"Draymond Green\")^ | 22[35]  \n19 | Abdul-Jabbar, Kareem[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\")* | 21[36]  \nRichardson, Micheal Ray[Micheal Ray Richardson](/wiki/Micheal_Ray_Richardson \"Micheal Ray Richardson\") | 21  \nBryant, Kobe[Kobe Bryant](/wiki/Kobe_Bryant \"Kobe Bryant\") | 21[37]  \n^ | Denotes active player  \n---|---  \n* | Inducted into the [Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame](/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame \"Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\")  \n  \n####\nFacts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Facts\")]\n\n  * **First triple-double in league history** : According to the Harvey J.

NBA's director of operations, [Rod Thorn](/wiki/Rod_Thorn \"Rod Thorn\"), requested to review the tape. After reviewing the tape, the league disallowed Olajuwon's quadruple-double and announced that his original line—with 9 assists—is official.[111][112]\n\n### Other

Although the [Metro Conference](/wiki/Metro_Conference \"Metro Conference\"), then home to both teams involved in this game, kept records in all of the relevant statistical categories in the 1984–85 season, the NCAA did not. Assists were not recorded throughout Division I women's basketball until 1985–86, and steals were not so recorded until 1987–88.[133]\n  2. **Jump up ^** Although Gonzales played for a school that is now a member of [NCAA Division II](/wiki/NCAA_Division_II \"NCAA Division II\"), the NCAA does not consider her quadruple-double to be official for two reasons. First, the [Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference](/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Athletic_Conference \"Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference\"), then as now home to both teams involved in this game, then competed in the [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics](/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics \"National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics\") (NAIA), and was not an NCAA conference until 1992–93.[140] In addition, the NCAA did not record steals throughout Division II women's basketball until 1992–93.[135]\n\n## Quintuple-\ndouble[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Quintuple-double\")]\n\nA **quintuple-double** is defined as a performance in which a player\naccumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical\ncategories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—-in a single\ngame.[142] There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both done at the high-\nschool level. The first was recorded by [Tamika\nCatchings](/wiki/Tamika_Catchings \"Tamika Catchings\") of [Duncanville High\nSchool](/wiki/Duncanville_High_School \"Duncanville High School\")\n([Duncanville, Texas](/wiki/Duncanville,_Texas \"Duncanville, Texas\")) with 25\npoints, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks in 1997.[143] The\nsecond was by Aimee Oertner of [Northern Lehigh High\nSchool](/wiki/Northern_Lehigh_High_School \"Northern Lehigh High School\")\n([Slatington, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Slatington,_Pennsylvania \"Slatington,\nPennsylvania\")), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11\nblocks on January 7, 2012.[144]\n\n## Five-by-\nfive[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Five-by-five\")]\n\nA **five-by-five** is defined as a performance in which a player accumulates a\ntotal of five in five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists,\nsteals, and blocks—in a single game.[145] Statistics for steals and blocks\nwere not kept in the NBA until the 1973–74 season, so NBA five-by-fives were\nonly possible from that season onward. [Hakeem Olajuwon](/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon\n\"Hakeem Olajuwon\") (six times) and [Andrei Kirilenko](/wiki/Andrei_Kirilenko\n\"Andrei Kirilenko\") (three times) are the only players to have recorded\nmultiple five-by-fives (based on records since the\n[1984–85](/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_NBA_season \"1984–85 NBA season\") season).[145]\nBoth are also the only players to record five-by-sixes (at least six in all\nfive statistical categories).[145] Only twice has a five-by-five coincided\nwith a triple-double (both by Olajuwon) and only three times has a player\nrecorded a five-by-five without registering at least a double-double (two by\nKirilenko and one by [Marcus Camby](/wiki/Marcus_Camby \"Marcus Camby\")).\n\n### NBA[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: NBA\")]\n\nThe following is a list of known five-by-fives.

since [1985–86](/wiki/1985%E2%80%9386_NBA_season\n\"1985–86 NBA season\"):\n\n  * **Greatest five-by-fives (most of each stat)** : Hakeem Olajuwon, on March 10, 1987, became the first in NBA history to record a five-by-six (at least 6 each of all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals).[163] It took nearly twenty years for the second official occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were not quite as impressive as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.\n  * **Most five-by-fives in a career** : Hakeem Olajuwon leads all players with 6 career five-by-fives.[145] Andrei Kirilenko, with 3, is the only other player with more than one career five-by-five.\n  * **Most five-by-fives in the same season** : Only twice has a player recorded two five-by-fives in a season. Olajuwon in the 1993–94 season, and Kirilenko in the 2003–04 season.\n  * **Quickest pair of five-by-fives** : Kirilenko performed a five-by-five on December 3, 2003, and completed another just a week later, on December 10, 2003. The second quickest five-by-fives were completed by Olajuwon on November 5, 1993, and another, 55 days later, on December 30, 1993.\n  * **Youngest player** : Kirilenko's first NBA five-by-five came on December 3, 2003, making him the youngest to record a five-by-five at age 22 years, 288 days.\n  * **Oldest player** : Olajuwon is the oldest player to record a five-by-five. His last career five-by-five came on December 30, 1993, at which time he was 30 years, 343 days old.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Double_\\(basketball\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Woods, David.
