He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden ([Gregory\nPeck](/wiki/Gregory_Peck \"Gregory Peck\")), a lawyer whom he holds personally\nresponsible for his conviction because Sam interrupted his attack and\ntestified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden's\nfamily. He kills the Bowden family dog, though Sam cannot prove Cady did it. A\nfriend of Bowden's, police chief Mark Dutton ([Martin\nBalsam](/wiki/Martin_Balsam \"Martin Balsam\")), attempts to intervene on\nBowden's behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime.\n\nBowden hires [private detective](/wiki/Private_detective \"Private detective\")\nCharlie Sievers ([Telly Savalas](/wiki/Telly_Savalas \"Telly Savalas\")). Cady\nbrutally attacks a promiscuous young woman named Diane Taylor ([Barrie\nChase](/wiki/Barrie_Chase \"Barrie Chase\")) when she brings him home, but\nneither the private eye nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. Bowden hires\nthree thugs to beat up Cady and persuade him to leave town, but the plan\nbackfires when Cady gets the better of all three. Cady's lawyer vows to have\nBowden [disbarred](/wiki/Disbar \"Disbar\").\n\nAfraid for his wife Peggy ([Polly Bergen](/wiki/Polly_Bergen \"Polly Bergen\"))\nand 14-year-old daughter Nancy ([Lori Martin](/wiki/Lori_Martin \"Lori\nMartin\")), Bowden takes them to their houseboat in [Cape\nFear](/wiki/Cape_Fear_\\(region\\) \"Cape Fear \\(region\\)\"). In an attempt to\ntrick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to a completely\ndifferent location. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and\nhe plans on killing Cady to end the battle. Bowden and a local deputy hide\nnearby, but Cady realizes the deputy is there and kills him. Eluding Bowden,\nCady first attacks Mrs. Bowden on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her\nrescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack Nancy. Bowden realizes\nwhat has happened, and also swims ashore.\n\nThe two men engage in a final violent fight on the riverbank. Bowden\noverpowers Cady, but decides not to kill him, preferring to let him spend the\nrest of his life in jail. The film ends with the Bowden family sitting\ntogether on a boat the next morning.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Gregory Peck](/wiki/Gregory_Peck \"Gregory Peck\") as Sam Bowden\n  * [Robert Mitchum](/wiki/Robert_Mitchum \"Robert Mitchum\") as [Max Cady](/wiki/Max_Cady \"Max Cady\")\n  * [Polly Bergen](/wiki/Polly_Bergen \"Polly Bergen\") as Peggy Bowden\n  * [Lori Martin](/wiki/Lori_Martin \"Lori Martin\") as Nancy Bowden\n  * [Martin Balsam](/wiki/Martin_Balsam \"Martin Balsam\") as Mark Dutton\n  * [Jack Kruschen](/wiki/Jack_Kruschen \"Jack Kruschen\") as Dave Grafton\n  * [Telly Savalas](/wiki/Telly_Savalas \"Telly Savalas\") as Charlie Sievers\n  * [Barrie Chase](/wiki/Barrie_Chase \"Barrie Chase\") as Diane Taylor\n  * [Paul Comi](/wiki/Paul_Comi \"Paul Comi\") as George Garner\n  * [Edward Platt](/wiki/Edward_Platt \"Edward Platt\") as Judge\n  * [Will Wright](/wiki/Will_Wright_\\(actor\\) \"Will Wright \\(actor\\)\") as Dr. Pearsall\n  * [Joan Staley](/wiki/Joan_Staley \"Joan Staley\") as Waitress\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[Rod Steiger](/wiki/Rod_Steiger \"Rod Steiger\") wanted to play Max Cady, but he\nbacked off when he heard Mitchum was considering the role.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Telly\nSavalas was screentested for the role, but later played private eye Charlie\nSievers.[1]\n\n[Charles Bronson](/wiki/Charles_Bronson \"Charles Bronson\"), [James\nCoburn](/wiki/James_Coburn \"James Coburn\"), [Charlton\nHeston](/wiki/Charlton_Heston \"Charlton Heston\"), [Jack\nPalance](/wiki/Jack_Palance \"Jack Palance\"), and [John Wayne](/wiki/John_Wayne\n\"John Wayne\"), were all considered for the role of the attorney, Sam\nBowden.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] Peck was a last-minute replacement for Heston, who was originally\ncast.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n[Jim Backus](/wiki/Jim_Backus \"Jim Backus\") was set to play attorney Dave\nGrafton.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nThompson had always envisioned the film in black and white prior to\nproduction. As an [Alfred Hitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock \"Alfred\nHitchcock\") fan, he wanted to have [Hitchcockian](/wiki/Hitchcockian\n\"Hitchcockian\") elements in the film, such as unusual lighting angles, an\neerie musical score, closeups, and subtle hints rather than graphic depictions\nof the violence Cady has in mind for the family.\n\nThe outdoor scenes were filmed on location in [Savannah,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\"), [Stockton,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Stockton,_California \"Stockton, California\"), and the\nUniversal Studios backlot at [Universal City,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Universal_City,_California \"Universal City, California\").\nThe indoor scenes were done at Universal Studios Soundstage. Mitchum had a\nreal-life aversion to Savannah, where as a teenager, he had been charged with\nvagrancy and put on a [chain gang](/wiki/Chain_gang \"Chain gang\"). This\nresulted in a number of the outdoor scenes' being shot at Ladd's Marina in\nStockton, including the culminating conflict on the houseboat at the end of\nthe movie.\n\nThis scene where Mitchum attacks Polly Bergen's character on the houseboat was\nalmost completely improvised.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Before\nthe scene was filmed, Thompson suddenly told a crew member: \"Bring me a dish\nof eggs!\" Mitchum's rubbing the eggs on Bergen was not scripted and Bergen's\nreactions were real. She also suffered back injuries from being knocked around\nso much. She felt the impact of the \"attack\" for days.[2] While filming the\nscene, Mitchum cut open his hand, leading Bergen to recall: \"his hand was\ncovered in blood, my back was covered in blood. We just kept going, caught up\nin the scene. They came over and physically stopped us.\"[3]\n\nIn the source novel _[The\nExecutioners](/wiki/The_Executioners_\\(MacDonald_novel\\) \"The Executioners\n\\(MacDonald novel\\)\")_ , by [John D. MacDonald](/wiki/John_D._MacDonald \"John\nD. MacDonald\"), Cady was a soldier [court-martialed](/wiki/Court-martial\n\"Court-martial\") and convicted on then Lieutenant Bowden's testimony for the\nbrutal rape of a 14-year-old girl. The censors stepped in, banned the use of\nthe word \"rape\", and stated that depicting Cady as a soldier reflected\nadversely on U.S. military personnel.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\n[Bernard Herrmann](/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann \"Bernard Herrmann\"), as often in his\nscores, uses a reduced version of the symphony orchestra. Here, other than a\n46-piece string section (slightly larger than usual for film scores), he adds\nfour [flutes](/wiki/Flutes \"Flutes\") (doubling on two\n[piccolos](/wiki/Piccolos \"Piccolos\"), two [alto flutes](/wiki/Alto_flute\n\"Alto flute\") in G, and two [bass flutes](/wiki/Bass_flute \"Bass flute\") in C)\nand eight [French horns](/wiki/French_horn \"French horn\"). No use is made of\nfurther wind instruments or percussion.[4]\n\nIn his 2002 book _A Heart at Fire 's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard\nHerrmann_, Stephen C. Smith writes:\n\n> \"Yet Herrmann was perfect for _Cape Fear_ ... Herrmann's score reinforces\n> _Cape Fear 's_ savagery. Mainly a synthesis of past devices, its power comes\n> from their imaginative application and another ingenious orchestration ... a\n> rehearsal for his similar orchestration on Hitchcock's _[Torn\n> Curtain](/wiki/Torn_Curtain \"Torn Curtain\")_ in 1966. Like similar\n> \"psychological\" Herrmann scores, dissonant string combinations suggest the\n> workings of a killer's mind (most startlingly in a queasy device for\n> [cello](/wiki/Cello \"Cello\") and [bass viols](/wiki/Bass_viol \"Bass viol\")\n> as Cadey prepares to attack the prostitute). Hermann's prelude searingly\n> establishes the dramatic conflict: descending and ascending chromatic voices\n> move slowly towards each other from their opposite registers, finally\n> crossing–just as Bodens and Cadey's game of cat-and-mouse will end in deadly\n> confrontation.\"[5]\n\n##\nDistribution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Distribution\")]\n\nAlthough the word \"rape\" was entirely removed from the script before shooting,\nthe film still enraged the censors, who worried that \"there was a continuous\nthreat of sexual assault on a child.\" To accept the film, British censors\nrequired extensive editing and deleting of specific scenes. After making\naround 6 minutes of cuts, the film still nearly garnered a British X rating\n(meaning at the time, \"Suitable for those aged 18 and older\", not necessarily\nmeaning there was sexually explicit or violent content).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Home\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cape_Fear_\\(1962_film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Home media\")]\n\n_Cape Fear_ was first made available on VHS on March 1, 1992.
