Upon realizing no one can see or hear him,\nhe disappears. Three hundred years later, Jack, as the young Spirit of Winter,\nenjoys delivering snow days to school kids, but resents that they do not\nbelieve in him. At the [North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\"), the [Man\nin the Moon](/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon \"Man in the Moon\") warns [Nicholas St.\nNorth](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\") that [Pitch Black](/wiki/Bogeyman\n\"Bogeyman\") is threatening the children of the world with his nightmares. He\ncalls [E. Aster Bunnymund](/wiki/Easter_Bunny \"Easter Bunny\"),\n[Sandy](/wiki/Sandman \"Sandman\"), and [Tooth](/wiki/Tooth_Fairy \"Tooth\nFairy\"), to arms. They are then told that Jack Frost has been chosen to be a\nnew Guardian.\n\nVisiting Tooth's world, Jack learns that each and every [baby\ntooth](/wiki/Baby_teeth \"Baby teeth\") contains childhood memories of the\nchildren who lost it, Jack's teeth included. However, Pitch raids Tooth's\nhome, kidnapping all of her subordinate tooth fairies except Baby Tooth and\nstealing all the teeth, thus preventing Tooth from sharing Jack's memories and\nweakening children's belief in Tooth. In order to thwart Pitch's plan, the\ngroup decides to collect children's teeth. During their journey, a quarrel\nbetween North and Bunnymund awakens a boy, Jamie. Since he still believes, he\ncan see everybody except for Jack. Pitch's nightmares then attack, provoking\nSandy as the Guardian of Dreams. Jack tries to intervene, but Sandy is\noverwhelmed and killed by Pitch.\n\nAs Easter approaches, the dejected Guardians gather in Bunnymund's home. With\nthe unexpected aid of Jamie's little sister, Sophie, they begin the process of\npainting eggs for Easter. After Jack takes Sophie home, he is lured to Pitch's\nlair by a voice. Pitch taunts him with his memories and fear of non-belief,\ndistracting him long enough for Pitch to destroy the eggs, causing children to\nstop believing in Easter and Bunnymund. Losing his trust in the Guardians,\nJack isolates himself in Antarctica, where Pitch tries to convince him to join\nhis side. When Jack refuses, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack\ngives him his staff, the source of his magic. He agrees, but Pitch breaks\nJack's staff and throws him down a chasm. Unlocking his memories, he learns\nthat he was a mortal teenager who fell into ice while saving his younger\nsister. Inspired, Jack repairs his staff and returns to the lair to rescue the\nkidnapped baby fairies.\n\nIn New York Due to Pitch, every child in the world except Jamie disbelieves,\ndrastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamie's belief wavering, Jack\nmakes it snow in his room, renewing Jamie's belief and letting him see Jack.\nJack and Jamie gather the boy's friends, whose renewed belief bolsters their\nfight against Pitch. Pitch threatens them, but their dreams prove stronger\nthan his nightmares, resulting in Sandy's resurrection. Defeated and\ndisbelieved in, Pitch tries to retreat, but his nightmares, sensing his own\nfears, turn on him and trap him in his lair. Afterward, Jamie and his friends\nbid goodbye to the Guardians as Jack accepts his place as the Guardian of Fun.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Guardians&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Chris Pine](/wiki/Chris_Pine \"Chris Pine\") as [Jack Frost](/wiki/Jack_Frost \"Jack Frost\"), the spirit of winter.[7] Jack Frost is a teenage hellion who enjoys creating mischief and has no interest in being bound by rules or obligations; he just wants to use his staff to spread his winter magic for the sake of fun, but also wants to be believed in. At the end of the film, Jack became the Guardian of Fun. While he cannot fly, per se, he can be carried on currents of wind, allowing him to span great distances.\n  * [Alec Baldwin](/wiki/Alec_Baldwin \"Alec Baldwin\") as Nicholas St. North ([Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\")), the leader of the guardians,[7] and the Guardian of Wonder. He lives at the [North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\") in the Ice Castle and is served by loyal North Pole natives, the [Yetis](/wiki/Yeti \"Yeti\") (who built the castle and workshop) and the [Christmas Elves](/wiki/Christmas_elf \"Christmas elf\").

Assisted by mini fairies that are split-off extensions of herself, she collects the children's teeth, which hold their most precious memories. Tooth stores them in her palace and returns memories when they are needed the most.[9] She seems to have a crush on Jack, (or more acurately, his pure white teeth).\n  * [Jude Law](/wiki/Jude_Law \"Jude Law\") as Pitch Black ([The Boogeyman](/wiki/Bogeyman \"Bogeyman\")), the essence of fear and the Nightmare King.[7]\n  * [Dakota Goyo](/wiki/Dakota_Goyo \"Dakota Goyo\") as Jamie Bennett, a child who has not given up on believing in the Guardians.[10]\n  * Sandy ([The Sandman](/wiki/Sandman \"Sandman\")), the Guardian of Dreams is the oldest of the Guardians[11] and the first Guardian chosen by Man in the Moon.[12] He does not speak, but communicates through sand images that he conjures above his head.[13]\n  * Georgie Grieve as Sophie Bennett, Jamie's little sister\n  * Dominique Grund as Cupcake\n  * Olivia Mattingly as Pippa\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Guardians&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nIn 2005, [William Joyce](/wiki/William_Joyce_\\(writer\\) \"William Joyce\n\\(writer\\)\") and [Reel FX](/wiki/Reel_FX_Creative_Studios \"Reel FX Creative\nStudios\") launched a joint venture, Aimesworth Amusements,[14] to produce CG-\nanimated feature films,[15] one of which was set to be _The Guardians of\nChildhood_ , based on Joyce's idea.[16] The film was not realized, but they\ndid create a short animated film, _The Man in the Moon_ , directed by Joyce,\nwhich introduced the Guardians idea,[16] and served as an inspiration for the\nfilm.[2]\n\nEarly in 2008, Joyce sold the film rights to DreamWorks Animation,[17] after\nthe studio assured him it would respect his vision for the characters and that\nhe would be involved with the creative process.[18] In November 2009, it was\nrevealed that DreamWorks had hired Peter Ramsey to make his feature debut as\ndirector of what was then titled _The Guardians_ , and\n[playwright](/wiki/Playwright \"Playwright\") [David Lindsay-\nAbaire](/wiki/David_Lindsay-Abaire \"David Lindsay-Abaire\") to script.[19]\nJoyce acted as a co-director for the first few years, but left this position\nafter the death of his daughter Mary Katherine,[17] who died of a brain\ntumor.[18] Joyce continued to assist as an executive producer, while Ramsey\ntook over full directing, making him the first [African\nAmerican](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") to direct a big-budget CG\nanimated film.[20] As with some previous DreamWorks films, [Guillermo del\nToro](/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro \"Guillermo del Toro\") came on board as an\nexecutive producer. Present almost from the beginning,[21] he was able to help\nshape the story, character design, theme and structure of the film.[22] He\nsaid he was proud that the filmmakers were making parts of the film \"dark and\nmoody and poetic,\" and expressed hope this might \"set a different tone for\nfamily movies, for entertainment movies.\"[21] The final title, _Rise of the\nGuardians_ was announced in early 2011, along with the first cast.[7]\n\n[Roger Deakins](/wiki/Roger_Deakins \"Roger Deakins\"), the cinematographer who\nhad already worked on the previous DreamWorks' film, _[How to Train Your\nDragon](/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_\\(film\\) \"How to Train Your Dragon\n\\(film\\)\")_ , advised on the lighting to achieve its real look. He selected\nphotographic references for color keys, and during the production gave notes\non contrast, saturation, depth of field and light intensity.[23] The film\ncontains a lot of special effects, particularly the volumetric particles for\ndepicting Sandman and Pitch.[24] For this, DreamWorks Animation developed\nOpenVDB, a more efficient tool and format for manipulating and storing volume\ndata, like smoke and other amorphous materials. OpenVDB had been already used\non _[Puss in Boots](/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_\\(2011_film\\) \"Puss in Boots \\(2011\nfilm\\)\")_ and _[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most\nWanted](/wiki/Madagascar_3:_Europe%27s_Most_Wanted \"Madagascar 3: Europe's\nMost Wanted\")_, and was released in August 2012 for free as an open-source\nproject with a hope to become an industry standard.[25]\n\nAlthough the film is based on the Joyce's book series, it contains differences\nfrom the books. The book series, begun in 2011, explains the origins of the\ncharacters, while the film takes place about 300 years after the books, and\nshows how the characters function in present time. Joyce explained, \"Because I\ndon't want people to read the book and then go see the movie and go, 'Oh, I\nlike the book better,' and I also didn't want them to know what happens in the\nmovie. And I also knew that during the progress of film production, a lot of\nthings can change. So I wanted to have a sort of distance, so we were able to\ninvoke the books and use them to help us figure out the world of the movie,\nbut I didn't want them to be openly competitive to each other.\"[17] The idea\nfor the Guardians came from Joyce's daughter, who asked him \"if he thought\nSanta Claus had ever met the Easter Bunny.\" The film includes a dedication to\nher,[18] as well a song, \"Still Dream,\" sung over the end credits.[26]\n\nOriginally, the film was set to be released on November 2, 2012, but\nDreamWorks Animation pushed the film to November 21, 2012 to avoid competition\nwith [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\")'s upcoming film _[Monsters\nUniversity](/wiki/Monsters_University \"Monsters University\")_ , which in turn\nhad been pushed to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with _[The Twilight\nSaga: Breaking Dawn – Part\n2](/wiki/The_Twilight_Saga:_Breaking_Dawn_%E2%80%93_Part_2 \"The Twilight Saga:\nBreaking Dawn – Part 2\")_.[27] _Monsters University_ was then pushed to June\n21, 2013, with [Disney's](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios \"Walt Disney\nAnimation Studios\") _[Wreck-It Ralph](/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph \"Wreck-It Ralph\")_\ntaking its place.[28]\n\n##\nSoundtrack[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Guardians&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Soundtrack\")]\n\nFrench composer [Alexandre Desplat](/wiki/Alexandre_Desplat \"Alexandre\nDesplat\") composed the original music for the film, which was released on\nNovember 13, 2012 by [Varèse Sarabande](/wiki/Var%C3%A8se_Sarabande \"Varèse\nSarabande\"). The [score](/wiki/Film_score \"Film score\") was recorded in London\nat [Abbey Road Studios](/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios \"Abbey Road Studios\") and\n[Air Studios](/wiki/Associated_Independent_Recording \"Associated Independent\nRecording\"), and performed by the [London Symphony\nOrchestra](/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra \"London Symphony Orchestra\"), with\na choral contribution by [London Voices](/wiki/London_Voices \"London Voices\").\n[David Lindsay-Abaire](/wiki/David_Lindsay-Abaire \"David Lindsay-Abaire\")\nwrote the lyrics for the end-credit song, \"Still Dream,\" which was performed\nby soprano [Renée Fleming](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Fleming \"Renée Fleming\").[29]\nStravinsky's Firebird Suite can also be heard during the scene where North\nfirst appears.
