He was also the uncredited vocalist for the song \"[You're a\nMean One, Mr. Grinch](/wiki/You%27re_a_Mean_One,_Mr._Grinch \"You're a Mean\nOne, Mr. Grinch\")\" from the classic [Christmas television\nspecial](/wiki/Christmas_television_special \"Christmas television special\"),\n[Dr. Seuss](/wiki/Dr._Seuss \"Dr. Seuss\")' _[How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas!](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!_\\(TV_special\\) \"How the\nGrinch Stole Christmas! \\(TV special\\)\")_[1]\n\nRavenscroft did some voice-over work and singing for\n[Disney](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\") in both the\nfilms and the attractions at [Disneyland](/wiki/Disneyland \"Disneyland\")\n(which were later featured at [Walt Disney World](/wiki/Walt_Disney_World\n\"Walt Disney World\")).

He achieved early success as part of a\nsinging group called [The Mellomen](/wiki/The_Mellomen \"The Mellomen\"). The\nMellomen can be heard on many popular recordings of the [Big\nBand](/wiki/Big_Band \"Big Band\") Era, including backup for [Bing\nCrosby](/wiki/Bing_Crosby \"Bing Crosby\"), [Frankie Laine](/wiki/Frankie_Laine\n\"Frankie Laine\"), [Spike Jones](/wiki/Spike_Jones \"Spike Jones\"), [Jo\nStafford](/wiki/Jo_Stafford \"Jo Stafford\"), and [Rosemary\nClooney](/wiki/Rosemary_Clooney \"Rosemary Clooney\"). Their earliest\ncontribution to a Disney film was for\n_[Pinocchio](/wiki/Pinocchio_\\(1940_film\\) \"Pinocchio \\(1940 film\\)\")_ (1940),\nto which they contributed the song \"Honest John.\" This was deleted from the\nfilm but can still be heard in the supplements on the 2009 DVD. Despite the\nsong being cut off, Ravenscroft lent his voice to Monstro the whale in the\nfilm. They also contributed to other Disney films, such as _[Alice in\nWonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(1951_film\\) \"Alice in Wonderland\n\\(1951 film\\)\")_ and _[Lady and the Tramp](/wiki/Lady_and_the_Tramp \"Lady and\nthe Tramp\")_. The group appeared on camera in a few episodes of the [Disney\nanthology television series](/wiki/Disney_anthology_television_series \"Disney\nanthology television series\"); in one instance recording a canine chorus for\n_Lady and the Tramp_ and in another as a [barbershop\nquartet](/wiki/Barbershop_quartet \"Barbershop quartet\") that reminds [Walt\nDisney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\") of the name of the young newspaper\nreporter _Gallegher_. Ravenscroft is also heard with the quartet on some of\nthe _[Merrie Melodies](/wiki/Merrie_Melodies \"Merrie Melodies\")_ and _[Looney\nTunes](/wiki/Looney_Tunes \"Looney Tunes\")_ with [Mel Blanc](/wiki/Mel_Blanc\n\"Mel Blanc\") at [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") as well as\non radio \"driving [Jack Benny](/wiki/Jack_Benny \"Jack Benny\") crazy\" on [The\nJack Benny Program](/wiki/The_Jack_Benny_Program \"The Jack Benny Program\").\nDuring [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), Ravenscroft served\nas a civilian [navigator](/wiki/Flight_officer \"Flight officer\") contracted to\nthe [U.S. Air Transport\nCommand](/wiki/Air_Transport_Command_\\(United_States_Air_Force\\)#Record_of_the_ATC\n\"Air Transport Command \\(United States Air Force\\)\"), spending five years\nflying [courier](/wiki/Courier \"Courier\") missions across the north and south\n[Atlantic](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\"). Among the notables carried\non board his flights were [Winston Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston\nChurchill\") and [Bob Hope](/wiki/Bob_Hope \"Bob Hope\"). As he told an\ninterviewer: \"I flew Winston Churchill to a conference in Algiers and flew Bob\nHope to the troops a couple of times. So it was fun.\"[3]\n\nRavenscroft sang bass on Rosemary Clooney's \"[This Ole\nHouse](/wiki/This_Ole_House \"This Ole House\")\", which went to No. 1 in both\nthe United States and Britain in 1954, as well as Stuart Hamblen's original\nversion of that same song. He sang on the soundtrack for [Ken\nClark](/wiki/Ken_Clark_\\(actor\\) \"Ken Clark \\(actor\\)\") as \"Stewpot\" in\n_[South Pacific](/wiki/South_Pacific_\\(1958_film\\) \"South Pacific \\(1958\nfilm\\)\")_ , one of the top-selling albums of the 1950s. Singing with the\n[Johnny Mann](/wiki/Johnny_Mann \"Johnny Mann\") Singers,[4] his distinctive\nbass can also be heard as part of the chorus on 28 of their albums that were\nreleased during the 1960s and 1970s. He was also the bass singer on [Bobby\nVee](/wiki/Bobby_Vee \"Bobby Vee\")'s 1960 Liberty hit record \"[Devil or\nAngel](/wiki/Devil_or_Angel \"Devil or Angel\")\". [Andy\nWilliams](/wiki/Andy_Williams \"Andy Williams\")' recording of \"The 12 Days of\nChristmas\" features him as well. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ravenscroft was\nnarrator for the annual [Pageant of the Masters](/wiki/Pageant_of_the_Masters\n\"Pageant of the Masters\") art show at the [Laguna Beach,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Laguna_Beach,_California \"Laguna Beach, California\"),\nFestival of the Arts.\n\nHe sang the opening songs for the two Disney serials used on _The Mickey Mouse\nClub_ , _Boys of the Western Sea_ and _The Hardy Boys: Mystery of the\nApplegate Treasure_.\n\nHe sang the \"Twitterpatter Song\" and \"Thumper's Song\" on the Disneyland record\n_Peter Cottontail and other Funny Bunnies_.\n\nOn the Disneyland record _All About Dragons_ , he both provided the narration\nand sang the songs \"The Reluctant Dragon\" and \"The Loch Ness Monster\".[5]\n\nHis voice was heard during the [Pirates of the\nCaribbean](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_\\(attraction\\) \"Pirates of the\nCaribbean \\(attraction\\)\") ride as well as the [Haunted\nMansion](/wiki/Haunted_Mansion \"Haunted Mansion\") at\n[Disneyland](/wiki/Disneyland \"Disneyland\") as Uncle Theodore, the lead\nvocalist of the [singing\nbusts](/wiki/List_of_Haunted_Mansion_characters#Singing_Busts \"List of Haunted\nMansion characters\") in the cemetery near the end of the ride.[6] He also\nplayed the Narrator in _[The Story and Song From the Haunted\nMansion](/wiki/A_Spooky_Night_in_Disney%27s_Haunted_Mansion \"A Spooky Night in\nDisney's Haunted Mansion\")_. Ravenscroft is also heard in the [Enchanted Tiki\nRoom](/wiki/Enchanted_Tiki_Room \"Enchanted Tiki Room\") as the voice of Fritz\nthe [Animatronics](/wiki/Animatronics \"Animatronics\") parrot. He was also the\nvoice of the Disneyland Railroad in the 1990s. Further roles include that of\nThe First Mate on The Mark Twain Riverboat and of the American bison head\nnamed Buff at The Country Bear Jamboree.[7]\n\n## Later\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thurl_Ravenscroft&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Later career\")]\n\nOne of Ravenscroft's best-known uncredited works is as the vocalist for the\nsong \"[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch](/wiki/You%27re_a_Mean_One,_Mr._Grinch\n\"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\").\" His name was accidentally left out of the\ncredits, leading many to believe (erroneously) that the cartoon's narrator,\n[Boris Karloff](/wiki/Boris_Karloff \"Boris Karloff\"), sang the song, while\nothers cited [Tennessee Ernie Ford](/wiki/Tennessee_Ernie_Ford \"Tennessee\nErnie Ford\") as the song's signature voice.[1]\n\nRavenscroft also sang \"[No Dogs Allowed](/wiki/No_Dogs_Allowed \"No Dogs\nAllowed\")\" in the _[Peanuts](/wiki/Peanuts \"Peanuts\")_ animated motion picture\n_[Snoopy, Come Home](/wiki/Snoopy,_Come_Home \"Snoopy, Come Home\")_ and _I Was\na Teenaged Brain Surgeon_ for [Spike Jones](/wiki/Spike_Jones \"Spike Jones\").\n\nFor more than 50 years, he was the uncredited voice of [Tony the\nTiger](/wiki/Tony_the_Tiger \"Tony the Tiger\") for [Kellogg's Frosted\nFlakes](/wiki/Kellogg%27s_Frosted_Flakes \"Kellogg's Frosted Flakes\"). His\nbooming bass gave the cereal's tiger mascot a voice with the catchphrase\n\"They're g-r-r-r-eat!!!!\".[8]\n\nVarious record companies, such as Abbott, Coral, Brunswick, and \"X\" (a\ndivision of [RCA](/wiki/RCA \"RCA\")) also released singles by Ravenscroft,\noften in duets with little-known female vocalists, in an attempt to turn the\nbass-voiced veteran into a pop singer. These efforts were commercially\nunsuccessful, if often quite interesting. He was also teamed up with [The\nAndrews Sisters](/wiki/The_Andrews_Sisters \"The Andrews Sisters\") (on the [Dot\nRecords](/wiki/Dot_Records \"Dot Records\") album _The Andrews Sisters Present_)\non the cover of [Johnny Cymbal](/wiki/Johnny_Cymbal \"Johnny Cymbal\")'s \"[Mr.\nBass Man](/wiki/Mr._Bass_Man \"Mr. Bass Man\")\". The Mellomen released some\n[doo-wop](/wiki/Doo-wop \"Doo-wop\") records under the name Big John & the\nBuzzards, a name apparently given to them by the rock-and-roll-hating [Mitch\nMiller](/wiki/Mitch_Miller \"Mitch Miller\"). His lifelong dream, which he\nshared in an interview in 1999 with Peter Anthony Holder, was to record the\nentire [Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\") on tape, but [a big name\nactor](/wiki/James_Earl_Jones \"James Earl Jones\") \"beat him out\". However,\nbeing a devoted Christian, he appeared on many religious television shows such\nas _[The Hour of Power](/wiki/The_Hour_of_Power \"The Hour of Power\")_. In\n1970, he recorded an album called \"Great Hymns in Story and Song\", which\nfeatured him singing 10 hymns, each prefaced with the stories of how each hymn\ncame to be, with the background vocals and instrumentals arranged and\nconducted by [Ralph Carmichael](/wiki/Ralph_Carmichael \"Ralph Carmichael\").\n\n## Later life and\ndeath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thurl_Ravenscroft&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Later life and death\")]\n\nRavenscroft married June Seamans in 1946, and they had two children. June died\nin 1999 from unknown causes. Ravenscroft semi-retired and did not work at any\nother studio anymore, but he continued to voice Tony The Tiger through 2004\n(with limo transportation by Kellogg's) and also submitted to an interview\nthat year by the Disney \"Extinct Attractions Club\" website. He died in his\nhome on May 22, 2005, from [prostate cancer](/wiki/Prostate_cancer \"Prostate\ncancer\"). He was buried at the Memorial Gardens at the [Crystal\nCathedral](/wiki/Crystal_Cathedral \"Crystal Cathedral\") in [Garden Grove,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Garden_Grove,_California \"Garden Grove, California\").[2]\n\nIn the June 6, 2005, issue of the advertising industry journal _[Advertising\nAge](/wiki/Advertising_Age \"Advertising Age\")_ , Kellogg's ran an ad\ncommemorating Ravenscroft. The [headline](/wiki/Headline \"Headline\") read:\n\"Behind every great character is an even greater man.\" After his death, [Lee\nMarshall](/wiki/Lee_Marshall_\\(announcer\\) \"Lee Marshall \\(announcer\\)\")\nreplaced him as the voice of Tony the Tiger in the Kellogg's commercials, but\nsome commercials still recycle clips of Ravenscroft.\n\n##\nFilmography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thurl_Ravenscroft&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Filmography\")]\n\n  * _[Pinocchio](/wiki/Pinocchio_\\(1940_film\\) \"Pinocchio \\(1940 film\\)\")_ (1940) - Monstro\n  * _[Isle of Destiny](/wiki/Isle_of_Destiny \"Isle of Destiny\")_ (1940) - Sportsman Quartet Member\n  * _[Dumbo](/wiki/Dumbo \"Dumbo\")_ (1941) – Singer of \"Look Out For Mr. Stork\" and \"[Pink Elephants on Parade](/wiki/Pink_Elephants_on_Parade \"Pink Elephants on Parade\")\"\n  * _[The Nifty Nineties](/wiki/The_Nifty_Nineties \"The Nifty Nineties\")_ (1941) - Singer\n  * _[Saludos Amigos](/wiki/Saludos_Amigos \"Saludos Amigos\")_ (1942) - Singer of the main title theme\n  * _[Melody Time](/wiki/Melody_Time \"Melody Time\")_ (1948) - Singer\n  * _[Alice in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_\\(1951_film\\) \"Alice in Wonderland \\(1951 film\\)\")_ (1951) – Card Painter\n  * _[Jack and the Beanstalk](/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk_\\(1952_film\\) \"Jack and the Beanstalk \\(1952 film\\)\")_ (1952) – Singing voices of two villagers\n  * _[Peter Pan](/wiki/Peter_Pan_\\(1953_film\\) \"Peter Pan \\(1953 film\\)\")_ (1953) – Singer, Pirates\n  * _[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom](/wiki/Toot,_Whistle,_Plunk_and_Boom \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\")_ (1953) - Singer\n  * _[Rose Marie](/wiki/Rose_Marie_\\(1954_film\\) \"Rose Marie \\(1954 film\\)\")_ (1954) – Medicine Man\n  * _[Lady and the Tramp](/wiki/Lady_and_the_Tramp \"Lady and the Tramp\")_ (1955) – Al the Alligator, Singing Pound Dogs\n  * _[Paul Bunyan](/wiki/Paul_Bunyan_\\(film\\) \"Paul Bunyan \\(film\\)\")_ (1958) - Paul Bunyan\n  * _[Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959 film\\)\")_ (1959) – Singer\n  * _[The 101 Dalmatians](/wiki/One_Hundred_and_One_Dalmatians \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\")_ (1961) – Captain the Horse\n  * _[Gay Purr-ee](/wiki/Gay_Purr-ee \"Gay Purr-ee\")_ (1962) – Hench Cat\n  * _[The Sword in the Stone](/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_\\(film\\) \"The Sword in the Stone \\(film\\)\")_ (1963) – Black Bart\n  * _[Mary Poppins](/wiki/Mary_Poppins_\\(film\\) \"Mary Poppins \\(film\\)\")_ (1964) – Someone's voice of banker, pig, animal sounds\n  * _[The Man from Button Willow](/wiki/The_Man_from_Button_Willow \"The Man from Button Willow\")_ (1965) - Singer, Reverend, Saloon Man\n  * _[The Grinch](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!_\\(TV_special\\) \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!
