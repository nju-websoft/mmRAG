The exact value of this\nconstant varies from 1.34 to 1.39, depending on the reference and the way it\nis derived. The constant 0.0031 represents the amount of oxygen dissolved in\nplasma. The dissolved-oxygen term is generally small relative to the term for\nhemoglobin-bound oxygen, but becomes significant at very high PaO2 (as in a\n[hyperbaric chamber](/wiki/Hyperbaric_chamber \"Hyperbaric chamber\")) or in\nsevere [anemia](/wiki/Anemia \"Anemia\").[12]\n\n### Oxygen\nsaturation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blood_gas_tension&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Oxygen saturation\")]\n\n     S O 2 = ( 23 , 400 p O 2 3 + 150 p O 2 + 1 ) − 1 {\\displaystyle SO_{2}=({\\frac {23,400}{pO_{2}^{3}+150pO_{2}}}+1)^{-1}} ![SO_{2}=\\({\\\\frac  {23,400}{pO_{2}^{3}+150pO_{2}}}+1\\)^{{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dbe580da6b57a6f56538b235f32eff2a9ee14cd8)\n\nThis is an estimation and does not account for differences in temperature, pH\nand concentrations of 2,3 DPG.[13]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blood_gas_tension&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Alveolar air equation](/wiki/Alveolar_air_equation \"Alveolar air equation\")\n  * [Fick's laws of diffusion](/wiki/Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion \"Fick's laws of diffusion\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blood_gas_tension&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Severinghaus JW, Astrup P, Murray JF (1998). \"Blood gas analysis and critical care medicine\". _Am J Respir Crit Care Med_. **157** (4 Pt 2): S114–22.
