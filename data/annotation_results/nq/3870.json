For the Canadian standardized test, see [Ontario Secondary School\nLiteracy Test](/wiki/Ontario_Secondary_School_Literacy_Test \"Ontario Secondary\nSchool Literacy Test\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/The_color_line_still_exists%E2%80%94in_this_case_cph.3b29638.jpg/170px-\nThe_color_line_still_exists%E2%80%94in_this_case_cph.3b29638.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_color_line_still_exists%E2%80%94in_this_case_cph.3b29638.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_color_line_still_exists%E2%80%94in_this_case_cph.3b29638.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nEditorial cartoon from the January 18, 1879, issue of _[Harper's\nWeekly](/wiki/Harper%27s_Weekly \"Harper's Weekly\")_ criticizing the use of\nliteracy tests.

Literacy tests have been administered\nby various governments to immigrants. In the United States, between the\n1850s[1] and 1960s, literacy tests were administered to prospective voters,\nand this had the effect of disenfranchising African Americans and others.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Voting\n  * 2 Immigration\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 Further reading\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Voting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Literacy_test&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Voting\")]\n\nFrom the 1890s to the 1960s, many state governments in the [United\nStates](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") administered\nliteracy tests to prospective voters purportedly to test their literacy in\norder to vote. In practice, these tests were intended to disenfranchise racial\nminorities. Southern state legislatures employed literacy tests as part of the\nvoter registration process starting in the late 19th century. Literacy tests,\nalong with [poll taxes](/wiki/Poll_tax_\\(United_States\\) \"Poll tax \\(United\nStates\\)\"), residency and property restrictions and extra-legal activities\n(violence, intimidation)[2] were all used to deny suffrage to [African\nAmericans](/wiki/African_Americans \"African Americans\"). The first formal\nvoter literacy tests were introduced in 1890. At first, whites were generally\nexempted from the literacy test if they could meet alternate requirements that\nin practice excluded blacks, such as a [grandfather\nclause](/wiki/Grandfather_clause \"Grandfather clause\") or a finding of \"good\nmoral character\".\n\nIn _[Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of\nElections](/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections \"Lassiter\nv. Northampton County Board of Elections\")_ (1959), the U.S. Supreme Court\nheld that literacy tests were not necessarily violations of Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor of the Fifteenth Amendment. Southern\nstates abandoned the literacy test only when forced to do so by federal\nlegislation in the 1960s. The [Civil Rights Act of\n1964](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\") provided that\nliteracy tests used as a qualification for voting in federal elections be\nadministered wholly in writing and only to persons who had completed six years\nof formal education.\n\nIn part to curtail the use of literacy tests, Congress enacted the [Voting\nRights Act of 1965](/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965 \"Voting Rights Act of\n1965\"). The Act prohibited jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to\ncitizens who attained a sixth-grade education in an American school in which\nthe predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico.[3] The\nSupreme Court upheld this provision in _[Katzenbach v.\nMorgan](/wiki/Katzenbach_v._Morgan \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\")_ (1966). Although\nthe Court had earlier held in _Lassiter_ that literacy tests did not violate\nthe Fourteenth Amendment,[4] in _Morgan_ the Court held that Congress could\nenforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such as the right to vote—by prohibiting\nconduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not\nbe independently unconstitutional.[5][6]\n\nAs originally enacted, the Voting Rights Act also suspended the use of\nliteracy tests in all jurisdictions in which less than 50% of voting-age\nresidents were registered as of November 1, 1964, or had voted in the [1964\npresidential election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1964\"). In 1970, Congress amended the Act and\nexpanded the ban on literacy tests to the entire country.[7] The Supreme Court\nthen upheld the ban as constitutional in _[Oregon v.\nMitchell](/wiki/Oregon_v._Mitchell \"Oregon v. Mitchell\")_ (1970), but just for\nfederal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority\nof justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.[8][9]\n\n## Immigration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Literacy_test&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Immigration\")]\n\nThe literacy test was a device to restrict the total number of immigrants\nwhile not offending the large element of ethnic voters. The \"old\" immigration\n(British, Irish, German, Scandinavian) had fallen off and was replaced by a\n\"new\" immigration from Italy, Russia and other points in Southern and eastern\nEurope. The \"old\" immigrants were voters and strongly approved of restricting\nthe \"new\" immigrants. All groups of American voters strongly opposed Chinese\nand Asian immigration. The 1896 Republican platform called for a literacy\ntest.[10]\n\nThe [American Federation of Labor](/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor\n\"American Federation of Labor\") took the lead in promoting literacy tests that\nwould exclude illiterate immigrants, primarily from Southern and Eastern\nEurope. A majority of the labor union membership were immigrants or sons of\nimmigrants from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain, but the literacy test would\nnot hinder immigration from those countries.[11]\n\nCorporate industry however, needed new workers for its mines and factories and\nopposed any restrictions on immigration.[12] In 1906, the House Speaker\n[Joseph Gurney Cannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\"), a\nconservative Republican, worked aggressively to defeat a proposed literacy\ntest for immigrants. A product of the western frontier, Cannon felt that moral\nprobity was the only acceptable test for the quality of an immigrant. He\nworked with Secretary of State [Elihu Root](/wiki/Elihu_Root \"Elihu Root\") and\nPresident [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\")\nto set up the \"[Dillingham Commission](/wiki/Dillingham_Commission \"Dillingham\nCommission\"),\" a blue ribbon body of experts that produced a 41-volume study\nof immigration. The Commission recommended a literacy test and the possibility\nof annual quotas.[13] Presidents Cleveland and Taft vetoed literacy tests in\n1897 and 1913. President Wilson did the same in 1915 and 1917, but the test\nwas passed over Wilson's second veto.[14]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Literacy_test&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Disfranchisement after the Civil War](/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_the_Civil_War \"Disfranchisement after the Civil War\")\n  * [Freedmen](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\")\n  * [Jim Crow laws](/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws \"Jim Crow laws\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Literacy_test&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Literacy Tests and the Right To Vote - ConnecticutHistory.org\"](http://connecticuthistory.org/literacy-tests-and-the-right-to-vote/). _connecticuthistory.org_.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Civil Rights Movement -- Literacy Tests & Voter Applications\"](http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm). _www.crmvet.org_.\n  3. **Jump up ^** Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 4(e); [52 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_52_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 52 of the United States Code\") [§ 10303(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10303\\(e\\)) (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(e))\n  4. **Jump up ^** _[Lassiter v.
