The Reactor column indicates titles compatible with Stardock Impulse's Reactor, which include online gaming features. Titles listed under the Goo column indicates titles are using Stardock Impulse's user friendly DRM Goo\n When a game is released, it should be moved to the appropriate section. This list should not contain vaporware. As Impulse was sold to GameStop in 2011 and discontinued in 2014 this list will likely be static and any upcoming games won't appear on this service.\n\n"
