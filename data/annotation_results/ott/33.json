The competition is made up of 32 teams, divided into two zones. It is played by teams from all over the country. Clubs from Buenos Aires surroundings, as well as some from Santa Fe Province, are promoted from or relegated to the Primera B Metropolitana (Metropolitan B Division) while for teams from the other provinces the Torneo Federal A (Federal A Tournament) is the next level down. In Argentine football, Nacional B is the second-highest league, and from it the three best teams are automatically promoted to Primera División. Primera B Nacional games are often transmitted to Argentina and abroad on television by TyC Sports.\n\n"
