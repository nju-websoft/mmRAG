        "List of conservation areas in Crawley\nName | Area | Year | Notes\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nBrighton Road | Southgate | 2009 | This area consists of Victorian and Edwardian buildings immediately south of the level crossing where the Arun Valley Line meets the London-Brighton road . Large houses and commercial buildings of various types , mostly of brown and red brick and some with elements of the Classical style , are typical . Modern buildings , refronted shop units and ill-defined areas of car parking are considered to affect the area 's appearance , though\nDyers Almshouses | Northgate | 1996 | This group of 30 architecturally distinctive almshouses are one of many works by local building firm Longley and Company . Built in three phases between 1939 and 1971 , they combine the Arts and Crafts style with elements reminiscent of rural Dutch cottage [ s ] . Large tile-hung gables , stock brick and intricate tall chimneys are prominent features . The houses were built for the Worshipful Company of Dyers , a London Livery Company\nForestfield and Shrublands | Furnace Green | 1996 | Architects Phippen Randall Parkes designed these two small and distinctive estates between 1965 and 1971 . Shrublands was completed first , in 1968 , and its design was based on suggestions made by members of the housing association for which it was built . These future residents were asked questions based on sociological theory . Open space was planned as an integral part of each estate , and the relationship between the houses and their surroundings ( in particular the nearby ancient woodland of Tilgate Forest ) is important . Forestfield has 125 houses in five equally sized clusters ; Shrublands has 71 in a more informal layout . Both estates won design awards\nHazelwick Road | Three Bridges | 2013 | After Three Bridges railway station became a junction in the 1840s , the village of Three Bridges to the east of Crawley grew in importance . Fields were developed with terraced and semi-detached houses and some larger villas ; Hazelwick Road , dating from the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th , is an example of higher-class housing alongside the smaller accommodation for railway workers . Features include bay windows , brickwork in various colours and original sash windows\nHigh Street | Town Centre | 1986 | The High Street and its buildings have been renewed and reconstructed regularly over the centuries , but it has always been of central importance to the town . The street widens halfway along , but no trace remains of the buildings that once occupied a central island . Some houses became coaching inns when coach traffic thrived , and hotels or restaurants after it declined ; others are now shops . Purpose-built shops such as Grand Parade followed in the 20th century . Several medieval hall houses survive\nIfield Village | Ifield | 1981 | The conservation area covers what was originally the central settlement in the large rural parish of Ifield , around the 13th-century St Margaret 's Church ( a replacement for a pre- Norman building ) . Many of the surrounding buildings are nationally or locally listed : the vicarage , the former school , the current and former Plough Inns , a house associated with Elizabeth Fry , and a 17th-century barn and granary which have been converted into a theatre . The village green , which retains an old boundary stone , is also within the conservation area\nLangley Lane ( † ) | Ifield | 2013 | This long lane , no more than a tree-lined cul-de-sac , was built up from the 15th century and has buildings from that era to the present . The Grade I-listed Ifield Friends Meeting House ( pictured ) is 17th-century , and other listed buildings include Apple Tree Farm ( at which substantial residential development took place in the early 21st century ) , Langley Grange , Finches Cottage and Old Inn Cottage . The lane forms an eastward extension to the Ifield Village conservation area\nMalthouse Road | Southgate | 2013 | The building firm James Longley and Company was based in the vicinity of this road , and it was responsible for most of the terraced cottages , semi-detached houses , detached houses and large villas which still characterise it . The street curves from north to west , following ancient field boundaries . Development started in 1899 . The five semi-detached villas at numbers 108-122 ( pictured ) have locally listed status\nSt Peter 's | West Green | 1996 | The hamlet of West Green was named by 1532 . Housing development in the second half of the 19th century caused it to merge with Crawley town centre to the east , and the growth prompted the opening of the spacious sandstone -built St Peter 's Church in 1893 . This forms the centre of the present conservation area . Brick cottages with contrasting quoins , porches and bargeboards are typical , and many open out straight on to the narrow streets . The area also has a commercial feel : some houses now have shop units at ground-floor level . Two pubs ( including the locally listed Swan Inn ) and a range of old trees enhance the area\nSouthgate Neighbourhood Centre | Southgate | 2013 | Each New Town neighbourhood centre had the same general set of buildings - a church , pub , shopping parade and a community centre . The planners tried to vary their designs and grouping as much as possible ; the mid-1950s shops at Wakehams Drive in Southgate take the form of an arcade with flats above , and St Mary 's Church ( 1958 ) is a striking concrete and glass Modernist building with a large metal spire and a tunnel-vaulted roof . The council describes it as one of the most successful neighbourhood centres\nSunnymead Flats | West Green | 1997 | Inspired by the Festival of Britain in 1951 and some contemporary flats in Stockholm , these six .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps { font-variant : small-caps } .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller { font-size:85% } y -shaped blocks of three-storey flats are built of brightly painted rendered concrete and were erected to house the builders who were working on early New Town residential developments . They are set in lawned grounds with trees and shrubs\nWest Street ( † ) | Southgate | 2013 | Like the Brighton Road area , of which this proposed conservation area forms a westward extension , West Street developed in the late Victorian era . Terraced and semi-detached houses with multicoloured brickwork are typical of the street . The extension would stretch into part of Springfield Road , whose houses are larger and have features such as sash windows and bargeboards\nWorth | Worth | 1987 | The centrepiece of the conservation area , the ancient village and its vast parish is one of the most powerful of Anglo-Saxon churches , St Nicholas ' ( pictured ) . Other than a tower added in 1871 by Anthony Salvin , little has changed for 1000 years . The ancient Forest of Worth spread across southern Surrey and northern Sussex , and ancient trees ( some protected by TPOs ) are important in the conservation area . The former rectory and a former toll house are among the other important buildings\n\nwiki_section_title: Conservation areas\n\nwiki_section_text: Symbol Key ( † ) This is classed as an extension to an existing conservation area rather than a separate area .\n\nintro: As of April 2013, there are 11 conservation areas in the borough of Crawley in West Sussex, England. Crawley has ancient origins as a market town, but following centuries of gradual growth it was transformed in the postwar era when it was selected as a New Town. The population is now over 100,000. Several areas retain their long-established character and buildings of historic interest, and some postwar parts of the town have been designated as conservation areas because of their architectural and social importance. The definition of a conservation area is a principally urban area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Such areas are identified according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Crawley Borough Council is responsible for creating conservation areas within its boundaries. As well as following the statutory definition, it states that conservation area status is granted on the basis of a number of factors and does not solely relate to the age of the buildings; for instance architectural interest and setting of an area are also important factors. Specific features of interest include historic street patterns, materials used in buildings, paths and boundaries, the character of the public realm, the relationship between buildings and surrounding open space, and a strong sense of place. Conservation area status regulates but does not preclude new construction, demolition or redevelopment work.\n\n"
