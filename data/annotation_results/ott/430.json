There are 37 extant species . The gray mouse lemur is one of as many as 21 tiny , nocturnal mouse lemur species . Fork-marked lemurs are the among the largest of the cheirogaleids .\n\nintro: Lemurs are strepsirrhine primates, all species of which are endemic to Madagascar. They include the smallest primate in the world, Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs 30 grams (1.1 oz), and range up to the size of the indri, which can weigh as much as 9.5 kilograms (21 lb). However, recently extinct species grew much larger. As of 2010, five families, 15 genera, and 101 species and subspecies of lemur were formally recognized. From 2000 through 2008, 39 new species were described and nine other taxa resurrected. By 2014, the number of species and subspecies recognized had increased to 113; of these, the IUCN classified 24 as Critically Endangered, 49 as Endangered, 20 as Vulnerable, three as Near Threatened, three as Least Concern and four as Data Deficient; two were yet to be evaluated. The number of lemur species is likely to continue growing in the coming years, as field studies, cytogenetic and molecular genetic research continues. There is not complete agreement over the latest revisions to lemur taxonomy, with some experts preferring an estimated 50 lemur species. The debates are likely to continue, as some scholars label the explosive growth of species numbers as taxonomic inflation. In many cases, classifications will ultimately depend upon which species concept is used. In the case of the lemurs of Madagascar, which have suffered extensively from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, nearly 25% of all species are either Endangered or Critically Endangered, most have yet to be extensively studied, and nearly all populations are in decline. For these reasons, taxonomists and conservationists favor splitting them into separate species to develop an effective strategy for the conservation of the full range of lemur diversity.\n\n"

                "Document Content Analysis": "The document discusses taxonomy and phylogenies of lemurs, including references to the Cheirogaleidae family, historical taxonomic classifications, and Malagasy primates in general.

                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Partially, as the document references the Cheirogaleidae family and Malagasy lemurs, which is tangentially related to the query. However, it lacks details about individuals or the classification process.",

                "Explanation": "The document provides some tangential context about lemur taxonomy and the Cheirogaleidae family, which are related to the query. However, it does not mention any professor, Australian affiliation, or specific classification by an individual. This makes the document partially relevant but insufficient to answer or significantly supplement the query."
