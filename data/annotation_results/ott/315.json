The ranking was originally published from 2007-2011 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) and has been published since 2012 by the National Taiwan University. It uses bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific paper performance. In addition to the overall ranking, it includes a list of the top universities in six fields and fourteen subjects. The rankings were introduced in 2007. The original ranking methodology favored toward universities with medical schools. In 2008, HEEACT began publishing a Field Based Ranking including six fields: agriculture and environmental sciences (AGE), clinical medicine (MED), engineering, computing, and technology (ENG), life sciences (LIFE), natural sciences (SCI), and social sciences (SOC). In 2010, HEEACT began publishing subject rankings in fields of various field of science and technology. Science fields are divided into physics, chemistry, mathematics, and geosciences. Technology fields are split up into electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering (including energy and fuels), materials science, and civil engineering (including environmental engineering). HEEACT ended the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities Project in 2012. Due to disagreement about ranking results, the Taiwanese education authorities announced that the government would no longer support the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan to do this ranking.\n\n"

                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document mentions '19' as a ranking in 2008, but this rank corresponds to 'National Cheng Kung University' located in Taiwan, not a university in San Francisco.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document contains rankings for multiple universities in 2008, but it does not provide any information directly identifying a university in San Francisco or its rank. Therefore, it does not confirm the rank of 19 for any such university.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not directly answer the query as it lacks any mention of a university in San Francisco or its position in the 2008 rankings.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "No, the document does not provide any related information that would help infer the query's answer because no university in San Francisco is listed or mentioned in the rankings.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "0",
                "Explanation": "The document lists rankings for many universities in 2008 but does not contain any mention of a university located in San Francisco or its rank. As a result, it cannot directly answer the query or help infer the required information. Thus, it is deemed irrelevant to the query."
