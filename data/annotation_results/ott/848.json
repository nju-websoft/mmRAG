Mike Lange is the play-by-play announcer, while former Penguin Phil Bourque is the color commentator. Josh Getzoff hosts pre- and post-game shows, as well as intermission breaks. The flagship station since 2006 is WXDX-FM in Pittsburgh. Mike Lange began doing team radio broadcasts in 1974, and after not working for the team during the 1975-76 year, rejoined the network for the 1976-77 season. He provided play-by-play for radio as well as television when the team began simulcast broadcasts. When the two broadcasts separated in the mid-1990s, Lange worked exclusively on television for FSN Pittsburgh. In 2006, FSN did not renew Lange's contract, and he rejoined the radio network. Paul Steigerwald worked with the team network from 1980 to 1999. He began with the team in 1980 performing interviews during intermissions. In 1984 he joined Lange as color analyst. When Lange moved to the television broadcast, Steigerwald became the play-by-play announcer.\n\n"
