Bolliger & Mabillard has built or is in the process of building a total of fifteen Wing Coasters as of January 2018 . The roller coasters are listed in order of opening dates .\n\nintro: A wing coaster is a type of steel roller coaster with a seat configuration that places riders in open air outside the edges of the track, in which nothing sits above or below the rider. Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M) manufacturers the most common form that places all riders to the side of the track, with rows of four that seat two on each side of the track. Their model, called Wing Coaster, made its debut in 2011 when Raptor opened at Gardaland amusement park. There are 13 installations around the world. Another manufacturer, Intamin, has two model variants of wing coasters and has three installations of them in operation. Their most recent model, also titled Wing Coaster, uses a different seat layout that places only the two outer seats of every four-person row in a wing configuration.\n\n"
