Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor 's part , but instead beat the boy to death . The case became an important legal precedent regarding the use of corporal punishment in schools\n1867 | The murder of Fanny Adams | 1 | Alton , Hampshire , England | Fanny Adams was a young English girl murdered by solicitor 's clerk Frederick Baker in Alton , Hampshire\n1946 | Murder of Muriel Drinkwater | 1 | Swansea , Wales | Muriel Drinkwater , 12 , was raped and murdered in the woods in Penllergaer , Swansea . The case became known as the Little Red Riding Hood murder .

The case went unsolved for 33 years , until Brian Field was convicted of the crime after DNA evidence surfaced .

It was presumed by police that Bridgewater had disturbed a burglar while delivering a newspaper to their home and was dragged into their living room where he was killed with a shotgun blast to the head . The following year , a group of men - widely referred to in the press as the Bridgewater Four - were convicted of the crime , three for murder and a fourth for manslaughter . The defendant convicted of manslaughter subsequently died in prison but the three convicted of murder were released in 1997 when their convictions were quashed on appeal . Nobody else has ever been charged\n1981 | The Murder of Karen Price ( Little Miss Nobody ) | 1 | Cardiff , Wales | Karen Price was a 15-year-old Welsh murder victim who disappeared in 1981 . After the discovery of her body in 1989 , British facial reconstruction artist Richard Neave used her skull to create a model of her physical appearance . The reconstruction and the matching of DNA in the body to that of Price 's parents allowed her body to be identified . The case was cited as one of the first instances in which DNA technology was used in this way . The police later concluded that Price had run away from home and turned to prostitution . In 1991 , Idris Ali and Alan Charlton , who were alleged to have managed her solicitation as a prostitute , were charged with her murder . Ali 's charge was eventually reduced to manslaughter , and he was released in 1994 . Charlton is still serving a life sentence\n1983 | The murder of Colette Aram | 1 | Keyworth , Nottinghamshire England | Colette Aram , a 16-year-old trainee hairdresser , was abducted , raped and strangled as she walked from her home to her boyfriend 's house in Keyworth , Nottinghamshire , on 30 October 1983 .

After the discovery of Bulger 's body two days later , Venables and Thompson were found guilty of murder in November that year and sentenced to be detained indefinitely . They spent eight years in custody before being released on life licence in 2001 . Venables was recalled to prison in early 2010 for breaching his licence conditions , having been caught possessing child pornography\n1994 | The murder of Richard Everitt | 1 | London , England | On 13 August 1994 , 15-year-old Richard Everitt was stabbed to death in London in a racially motivated attack . Everitt 's neighbourhood , Somers Town , had been the site of ethnic tensions , and although he was not involved in gangs , he was murdered by a gang of British Bangladeshis who were seeking revenge on another White British boy . The murderer was not apprehended , as members of the gang fled to Bangladesh . Badrul Miah and Showat Akbar were tried in 1995 as the ringleaders of the gang and were given life sentences , with minimum terms of 12 years and three years in custody respectively\n1994 | The murder of Daniel Handley | 1 | London , England | Nine-year-old Daniel Handley was lured away from his East London home in October 1994 and murdered by Timothy Morss and his partner Brett Tyler . They were sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1996 after admitting the murder . They had sexually abused Handley before murdering him and abandoning his body near Bristol , where it was found five months later . The trial judge described the pair as vultures and recommended they should never be set free . After their trial , it was revealed that both had convictions for sexual offences against children . In 2002 the then-Home Secretary David Blunkett sought to impose 50-year tariffs on Morss and Tyler , but they were overturned within 24 hours by both the High Court for England and Wales and the European Court of Human Rights\n1996 | The Michael Stone Killings | 2 | Kent , England | Michael Stone was convicted in October 1998 of the July 1996 murders of Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan , who were killed in a hammer attack . He was also convicted of attempting to murder Mrs Russell 's nine-year-old daughter Josie , who suffered serious head injuries . He has continued to assert his innocence since his conviction . His original conviction was overturned on appeal but a second trial in 2002 resulted in another guilty verdict after another prisoner claimed that Stone had confessed to the killings while on remand in jail . His most recent appeal , in 2004 , also failed\n1997 | The murder of Billie-Jo Jenkins | 1 | Hastings , East Sussex , England | 13-year-old Billie-Jo Jenkins was murdered on 15 February 1997 at the home where she lived with her foster parents . Her foster father , Si√¥n Jenkins , was charged with the murder and later convicted , but maintained his innocence . An appeal in 1999 against his conviction failed , but after a second appeal in August 2004 it was quashed by a court as unsafe and he was released on bail pending a retrial . The juries in two subsequent retrials were unable to reach verdicts , and a not guilty verdict was recorded in 2006 . Nobody else has been arrested since his acquittal and the case remains unsolved\n\nwiki_section_title: Child killings -- 19th and 20th centuries\n\nwiki_section_text: \n\nintro: This is a list of major crimes in the United Kingdom that received significant media coverage or led to changes in legislation.
