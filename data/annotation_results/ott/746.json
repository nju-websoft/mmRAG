The new Big East consists of the seven members of the original Big East that did not sponsor Division I FBS football (the so-called Catholic 7), plus invited founding members Butler, Creighton, and Xavier. The FBS schools sold the Big East name to the Catholic 7 and are operating as the American Athletic Conference under the original Big East charter. Including the history of the original Big East, this will be the 18th season of men's soccer under the Big East name. The defending champions are the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\n"
