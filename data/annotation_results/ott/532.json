The lowest standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 17% , although member states can apply reduced rates of VAT to certain goods and services . Certain goods and services are required to be exempt from VAT ( for example , postal services , medical care , lending , insurance , betting ) , and certain other goods and services to be exempt from VAT but subject to the ability of an EU member state to opt to charge VAT on those supplies ( such as land and certain financial services ) . Input VAT that is attributable to exempt supplies is not recoverable . VAT standard rate in European countries\n\nintro: The European Union value-added tax (or EU VAT) is a value added tax on goods and services within the European Union (EU). The EU's institutions do not collect the tax, but EU member states are each required to adopt a value added tax that complies with the EU VAT code. Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states, ranging from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary. The total VAT collected by member states is used as part of the calculation to determine what each state contributes to the EU's budget.\n\n"
