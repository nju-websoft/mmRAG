website : [ 1 ]\n\nintro: The Brazilian gubernatorial elections, 2010 will be held on Sunday, October 3, as part of the country's general election. In these elections, all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District governorships will be up for election. If none of the candidates receives more than a half of the valid votes, a run-off will be held on October 24, 2010. According to the Federal Constitution, Governors are elected directly to a four-year term, with a limit of two terms. Eleven governors are prohibited from seeking re-election. Currently, ten of the total seats are held by the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), followed by five held by the Workers' Party (PT) and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) each. The Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) holds three seats, and the Progressive Party (PP) holds two. The Democratic Labour Party (PDT) and the Republic Party (PR) holds one seat each. Some Governors are not the same from the outcome of the previous election, since some of them had their terms repealed by the Supreme Electoral Court. These elections will coincide with the presidential election, as well as the elections for Legislative Assemblies and both houses of the National Congress. These will be the 8th direct gubernatorial elections, and the sixth since the end of the military dictatorship.\n\n"
