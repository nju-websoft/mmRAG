It was one of America's premier art foundries for many years, and cast works by some of the nation's leading sculptors. In 1892, the foundry was located at the west corner of 21st Street and Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia. By 1913, it had moved to the southeast corner of 23rd and Westmoreland Streets in North Philadelphia. In the late 20th century, the long-idled North Philadelphia building was used by a piano tuner to hold more than 200 pianos over two decades. In 2013, the building was taken over by Philadelphia Salvage, an architectural salvage company.\n\n"
