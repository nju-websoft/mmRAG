Half of these prizes (eight) have been awarded in the field of Physiology or Medicine Most Australians awarded Nobel prizes before the end of the awarding of British/Imperial honours (in 1992) also received (or were offered) knighthoods. This list includes laureates who were not born in Australia, but who nevertheless spent a significant portion of their training or career there.\n\n"
