It began on 7 February with Agrochemical and Red Berets and ended on 21 November with Sony Sugar and Western Stima. Sofapaka had an alarmingly remarkable season, having just been promoted from the Nationwide League for the first time and immediately winning the title. They also won the Kenyan Super Cup the following season. Bandari and Agrochemical were relegated at the end of the season after replacing previously relegated Mahakama and Mathare Youth. However, Bandari gained promotion again for the 2011 season.\n\n"
