It premiered on May 4, 2010. This was the season with the most replacements, due to the withdrawals of two contestants (Luciana Salazar and Evangelina Anderson), and injuries to others. Season 6 was also the first in which the judges did not restore some of the losing couples to competition. Among the judges, Carmen Barbieri quit the show and was replaced by Moria Casán. Ricardo Fort quit the show twice and was replaced by the journalist Marcelo Polino and Luis Ventura. Fort came back for the season finale, but the production decided to dismiss him from the show. After two semi-finals, the season finale aired on December 20. Boxer Fabio Mole Moli and top model Paula Chaves danced against each other four times that night: Latin pop, Merengue, Reggaeton and Axé music. Fabio won with 50.24% of the public vote.\n\n"
