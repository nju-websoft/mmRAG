It was the fourteenth race of the 2005 FIA Formula One World Championship and the inaugural Turkish Grand Prix. The 58-lap race was won by Finnish driver Kimi Räikkönen, driving a McLaren-Mercedes. Räikkönen took his fifth victory of the season after starting from pole position and leading every lap. Räikkönen's Colombian teammate, Juan Pablo Montoya, ran second until he collided with a backmarker and then ran wide in the closing laps, allowing Spaniard Fernando Alonso through in his Renault. With five races remaining, Alonso led the Drivers' Championship by 24 points from Räikkönen, while Renault's lead over McLaren in the Constructors' Championship was nine points.\n\n"
