Roger Ebert, the TV and Chicago Sun-Times film critic, was a native of the adjoining town of Urbana, Illinois and is an alumnus of the University. Founded in 1999 as Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival, this event is the only long-running film festival created by a critic. Despite Eberts death in 2013, the festival continues to operate based on Eberts notes and vision for the kinds of films he championed.\n\n"
