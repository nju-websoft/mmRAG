Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the first event under the Bound for Glory name and tenth event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule. The show was promoted as TNA's premiere PPV event and their equivalent to the rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) WrestleMania. Ten professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match were featured on the card, three of which involved championships. The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which champion Jeff Jarrett fought the challenger Rhino with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee. The match was originally Jarrett versus Kevin Nash with Ortiz as referee, however Nash was not cleared to wrestle due to a medical emergency. A Ten-Man Gauntlet match was held to determine Nash's replacement, which Rhino won. Rhino then went on to defeat Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the show. The TNA X Division Championship was defended in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match by champion A.J. Styles against the challenger Christopher Daniels at the event. Styles defeated Daniels one fall to zero falls to retain the championship.\n\n"
