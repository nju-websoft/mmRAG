The Australian soccer league system consists of a national league - A-League (men) and W-League (women) - a state/territory-based second tier National Premier Leagues (NPL) structure and other state-based leagues. Promotion and relegation exists in some states between NPL and state leagues, however not between the A-League and the NPL. Included are all clubs playing in state (or territory)-wide leagues, or where states are split into two separate leagues.\n\n"
