It was the eighth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 38th Canadian Grand Prix. The 69-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from pole position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Giancarlo Fisichella third for the Benetton team. Michael Schumacher started from pole position alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled for first place until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello to take the lead until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello. The victory was Michael Schumacher's fifth of the season, his fourth at the circuit, and the result meant that he extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twenty-two points in front Coulthard, with Häkkinen a further two points behind. Ferrari also extended their lead in the Constructors' Championship, eighteen points ahead of McLaren.\n\n"
