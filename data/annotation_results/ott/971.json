                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not provide the name of the Grand Cru vineyard located in Morey-Saint-Denis and stretching to the border of Gevrey-Chambertin.",

                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant because it provides useful background information about the term 'Grand Cru' and its significance in Burgundy. However, it does not specifically address the query about the vineyard in Morey-Saint-Denis stretching to Gevrey-Chambertin. Thus, it provides some contextual information but cannot directly or indirectly answer the query."
