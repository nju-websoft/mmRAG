The columns Length, Author, and Producer indicate the length of the track, the author of the song (most often Wainwright alone), and the producer of the track. References are also provided for each song in the last column of the table. While many songs listed appear on multiple releases (for example, Spotlight on Christmas appears on Maybe This Christmas Too?, The McGarrigle Christmas Hour, and Elton John's Christmas Party), songs are listed based on the first release and only appear twice when the recordings have different production information (producer, length, etc.). The list includes original songs released on studio recordings, songs written but not performed by Wainwright, original songs performed live, and recorded cover songs.\n\n"
