Analogue BBC Two Wales closed on channel 63 and ITV1 Wales took over on that frequency for what would be its final 3 weeks of service , vacating channel 60 as it did so . The new BBC A multiplex started up at full power in 64-QAM mode on channel 60 , and Mux 1 on channel 55 closed .\n\nintro: The Carmel transmitting station, located half a mile (0.8km) SSW of the village of Carmel in Carmarthenshire, has been broadcasting terrestrial TV and radio services since the mid-1970s. The TV coverage area for the Carmel transmission station includes most of Carmarthenshire, the southern and eastern parts of Pembrokeshire; the southern fringes of Powys and Ceredigion; the northern part of Swansea. The Carmel signal is also receivable in parts of Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff. Places as far away as Merthyr Tydfil and the north Devon coast are also able to receive signals from Carmel. Carmel started to switch over to digital terrestrial TV broadcast services on 26 August 2009.\n\n"
