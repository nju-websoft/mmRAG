While the document confirms that Otero County is located in New Mexico, which is the fifth-largest state in the U.S., it does not provide specific information about cities, their populations, or the unique feature of hillside letters, which are critical to answering the query.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant as it includes general information about Otero County being part of New Mexico, which is helpful in confirming part of the query context. However, it lacks critical details about the city's population, the year 2010, or the presence of hillside letters. Therefore, while the document provides some assistance, it cannot directly answer the query or provide significant inference for the answer."
