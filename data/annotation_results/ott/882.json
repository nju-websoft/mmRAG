The group originated in China , wherein the 36 were divided into four clusters , with each cluster made up of nine animal-deity pairs ( 4 X 9 = 36 ) . The four clusters represent the four cardinal directions ( north , south , east , west ) . The animals are also grouped in triads—three animals are combined under one of 12 Zodiac Signs ( 3 X 12 = 36 ) . In Japan , the group appeared in the Nichū Reki 二中暦 , a Japanese calendar from the second half of the 14th century . Curiously , eight of the 36 appear “ fox like ” —almost identical in physical attributes . These eight ( presented below ) include the tanuki , mujna , fox , wolf , jackal , wild cat , and wild male-female dogs . The mujina , fox and rabbit are combined under the zodiacal sign of the rabbit . The tanuki , leopard , and tiger are combined under the zodiacal sign of the tiger . Western scholars have mistranslated tanuki and mujina for decades as “ badger ” or “ racoon-dog. ” But in extant artwork like that shown below , the beasts are clearly “ fox-like. ” It is therefore puzzling why Western scholars call them badgers and racoon dogs . : [ 20 ] [ 21 ]\n\nintro: The decans (/ˈdɛkənz/; Egyptian baktiu) are 36 groups of stars (small constellations) used in the Ancient Egyptian astronomy. They rose consecutively on the horizon throughout each earth rotation. The rising of each decan marked the beginning of a new decanal hour (Greek hōra) of the night for the ancient Egyptians, and they were used as a sidereal star clock beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (c. 2100 BCE). Because a new decan also appears heliacally every ten days (that is, every ten days, a new decanic star group reappears in the eastern sky at dawn right before the Sun rises, after a period of being obscured by the Sun's light), the ancient Greeks called them dekanoi (δεκανοί; pl. of δεκανός dekanos) or tenths. Decans continued to be used throughout the Renaissance in astrology and in magic, but modern astrologers almost entirely ignore them. [citation needed]\n\n"
