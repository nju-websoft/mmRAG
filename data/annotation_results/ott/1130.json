The tour was devised by the East Yorkshire Historic Churches Group and is divided into a southern circuit and a planned northern circuit. Work on the churches was financed by Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet (1772-1863) and his son Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet (1826-1913). The 4th Baronet engaged John Loughborough Pearson to work on churches at Garton on the Wolds, Kirkburn, Bishop Wilton and Hilston in Holderness. The 5th Baronet worked with the architects C. Hodgson Fowler, G.E.Street and Temple Moore. His achievements were far greater than his father's, and unparalleled elsewhere in Britain. He financed work on 17 rural churches between 1866 and 1913.\n\n"
