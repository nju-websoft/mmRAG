From late October to early November, the band performed ten shows in Latin America, with six shows scheduled in South America (including the band's first-ever performance in the countries of Ecuador and Paraguay), three shows in Mexico, and one show in Central America, where the band performed in Panama for the first time in their careers. Frontman Steven Tyler said of the tour, I'm looking forward to sweating up a storm with the crazy Latin American fans. From late November to early December, the band also performed eight shows in Japan. This marked the band's first performances in Japan in seven years.\n\n"
