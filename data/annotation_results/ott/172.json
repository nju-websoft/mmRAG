                "Explanation": "The document provides some context by identifying David Arquette as the lowest scoring jive dancer in season 13, but it does not connect this information to the character Jason Ventress or the show 'In Case of Emergency.' Therefore, while it offers useful context, it is not directly relevant to fully answering the query."
