[ 2 ]\n\nintro: The English Football League Two (often referred to as League Two for short or Sky Bet League Two for sponsorship reasons) is the third and lowest division of the English Football League (EFL) and fourth-highest division overall in the English football league system. Football League Two was introduced for the 2004-05 season. It was previously known as the Football League Third Division. Before the advent of the Premier League in 1992, the fourth-highest division was known as the Football League Fourth Division. At present (2018-19 season), Morecambe hold the longest tenure in League Two, last being outside the division in the 2006-07 season when they were promoted from the league then known as the Conference National (now the National League). There are currently three former Premier League clubs competing in League Two: Bradford City, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town.\n\n"
