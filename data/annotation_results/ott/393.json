The show generally followed the format of previous seasons, with 13 couples, although there were some changes, including two new dances (Argentine tango and Lindy Hop), and an occasional dance-off between the bottom two couples, in order to determine who will be eliminated. The show was again hosted by Tom Bergeron and Samantha Harris. Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba all returned as judges again this season. Olympic gold-medal-winning gymnast Shawn Johnson won the competition at the age of 17, making her the youngest champion until Laurie Hernandez (another Olympian gymnast) won in season 23 at 16. Shawn beat out Gilles Marini by less than 1%.\n\n"
