Delta Sigma Theta continues to Charter new chapters at both the Collegiate and Alumnae level. Individual Chapters are Chartered, not Founded, as only the Perpetual body was founded, and the founding occurred in 1913. Delta Sigma Theta has more than 940 Chapters located in the United States, England, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, the Virgin Islands, Liberia, Bermuda, Jamaica, The Bahamas, South Korea and Nigeria. The sorority's chapters are organized into seven regions and further sub-divided by state. While initially Alumnae / Graduate Chapters were named using the Greek Alphabet, the perpetual body of Delta Sigma Theta voted at the Twenty-Fourth National Convention, held in Detroit, Michigan on December 26-30, 1956, to abandon this practice. Following the vote, the Greek Letter names for the Alumnae Chapters are no longer in use or recognized by the Grand Chapter. Alumnae Chapters are instead named using their Geographic Location. This list includes Active, Inactive, Reassigned, and Retired undergraduate Chapters.\n\n"
