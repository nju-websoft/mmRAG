                "Query Analysis": "The query is asking for the number of appearances by an SC Bastia player, whose name starts with the initial 'H', and who has scored the most goals among such players.",
                "Query Keywords Extraction": "SC Bastia, player, initial H, most goals, appearances",
                "Answer Analysis": "The answer is 378, which represents the number of appearances made by the specified player in the query.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides a table of SC Bastia players with details such as position, career period at the club, number of matches (appearances), goals scored, and nationality. It also contains additional information in the 'intro' that mentions players with the record for most matches (429) and most goals (117) for SC Bastia, but not specific to players with the initial 'H'.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document matches keywords such as 'SC Bastia', 'player', and 'goals', and it contains multiple players whose names start with 'H'.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document includes information about appearances and goals of several players but does not directly mention the number 378.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document includes data about SC Bastia players whose names start with 'H' (e.g., Youssouf Hadji, Féthi Harek, Joël Henry, Pierrick Hiard, Angelo Hugues, etc.) and their appearances and goals. However, it does not specify which of them has the most goals or provide a connection to 378 appearances.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not provide enough information to directly determine the SC Bastia player with the initial 'H' who has scored the most goals or their number of appearances.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Partially, as the document lists players with the initial 'H' and their statistics (appearances and goals), which allows narrowing down the possible candidates but does not directly identify the player with the most goals nor match the appearance count in the answer.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant as it contains a list of SC Bastia players with names, appearances, and goals, including those whose names start with 'H'. However, it does not directly answer the query nor provide sufficient context to definitively determine the player with the most goals or match the number of appearances. It provides some useful context but falls short of fully answering the query."
