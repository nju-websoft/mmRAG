You can help by adding to it . ( January 2017 )\n\nintro: China has the largest number of tall buildings in the world, surpassing that of the second and third largest, the United States (800+) and Japan (250+), combined. As of early 2017, China has more than 1400 skyscrapers above 150 meters (492 ft) of which 48 are super-tall 300 meters (984 ft and above). The tallest tower in China is currently the Shanghai Tower, located in the namesake city at a height of 632 meters; it is the second-tallest building in the world. The previous 2 tallest buildings in mainland China have also been in Shanghai. The Chinese economic reform from 1978 onwards lead to a significant improvement in quality of living and economic capital. Of the 64 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of 350 metres (1,150 ft) or more in the world, 32 of them are in China (including Hong Kong).\n\n"
