Throughout the years they have come and gone different disciplines, and categories that grouped some of the disciplines. Currently disciplines contested in the World Cup are: Parallel giant slalom and Parallel slalom (grouped into Parallel category), Halfpipe, Big air and Slope style (grouped into AFU category) and the discipline-category of Snowboard cross. Some of these disciplines have played discontinuously in time. The only discipline contested in every season of the World Cup is the Halfpipe (and from 1996-97 season the Snowboard cross). There was an Overall classification until the 2009-10 season. Since then, the World Cup is divided into the three categories described above, some of which already existed before.\n\n"
