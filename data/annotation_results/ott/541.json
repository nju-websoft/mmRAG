The registry was established by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, which created the National Recording Preservation Board, whose members are appointed by the Librarian of Congress. The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of recordings selected yearly by the National Recording Preservation Board for preservation in the Library of Congress. The National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 established a national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The Act created the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation. The purpose of the Registry is to maintain and preserve sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board has selected recordings nominated each year to be preserved. The first four yearly lists each had 50 selections. Since 2006, 25 recordings have been selected annually. As of 2018[update], a total of 525 recordings have been preserved in the Registry. Each calendar year, public nominations are accepted for inclusion in that year's list of selections, which are announced the following spring. Each yearly list typically includes a few recordings that have also been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the National Archives' audiovisual collection.\n\n"

                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document mentions '1923' as the year associated with 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' but this is unrelated to the person or recording in question in the query.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document lacks any mention of the specific recording titled 'Go' or the performer associated with it. It provides general context about the National Recording Registry but does not contain information directly linking the content to answering the query.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not provide any information about the recording 'Go' or the person associated with it in the 2018 National Recording Registry.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "No, the document does not contain specific or related information that would aid in inferring the birth year of the person associated with 'Go' in the 2018 registry. It only provides context about unrelated recordings and the registry's purpose.",

                "Explanation": "The document does not contain any relevant information about the recording 'Go,' the 2018 National Recording Registry, or the performer whose birth year is being queried. While it provides general context about the National Recording Registry and mentions several recordings with associated years, none of this information is connected to the query. Therefore, the document is irrelevant to the query."
