As in most midterm elections,[citation needed] the party controlling the White House lost ground. Democrats did take five governorships from the Republicans, and Republicans took 11 governorships from the Democrats. An independent won one governorship previously held by a Republican. A Republican won one governorship previously held by an independent. Republicans held a majority of governorships for the first time since before the 2006 elections. One state, Louisiana, had no election for governor, but did feature a special election for lieutenant governor. Most gains from both parties were made in races where no incumbent was running, either due to term limits or voluntary retirement, but three incumbent governors were defeated. Democrats Ted Strickland of Ohio and Chet Culver of Iowa were defeated by Republicans in the general election, and Republican Jim Gibbons of Nevada lost in the primary, with the general election won by a Republican. These elections coincided with the elections for the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives as well as other state and local elections.\n\n"
