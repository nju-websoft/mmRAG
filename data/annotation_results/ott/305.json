        "List of fictional atheists and agnostics\nName | Game | Notes\n--- | --- | ---\nTed Strayer | Fallout 3 | A non-player character living in Rivet City . When Rev . Clifford tries to convince Strayer to believe in God , he responds that there is no way in hell\nAndrew Ryan | BioShock | Half Antagonist in BioShock , created the underwater city of Rapture as a refuge from a world consumed by government , altruism and religion . I believe in no God , no invisible man in the sky\nSibrand | Assassin 's Creed | In his last words to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad after the latter dealt with the Teutonic knight with his Hidden Blade and said that he would be safe in the arms of God soon enough , Sibrand replied that there was nothing waiting for him in the end , not even God or the afterlife , that they did not even exist and that it was the one thing what he feared most\nRodrigo Borgia | Assassin 's Creed II | During his duel with Ezio Auditore da Firenze at the Vatican Vault , after failing to activate the Vault door because he did not have any First Civilization DNA in him , Rodrigo told to Ezio in the middle of the duel that he looked for God in the vault , shocking Ezio , which led to the latter to ask whether God was really in the Vault . Rodrigo replied that God being in the Vatican vault was a more logical answer and far more interesting than God being in the sky with angels singing cherubim all around . Ezio then asked what God would do once Rodrigo entered the vault . Rodrigo replied he was only after power , which Ezio asked whether God would give it up easily . Rodrigo then told that whatever lay beyond the Vault wall would not be able to resist the Staff and Apple and that they were made for felling gods . Ezio , being already a believer , replied that God was omniscient and omnipotent , and that mere artifacts could not harm Him , to which Rodrigo falsely accused Ezio that he took up the image of God from other men . Ezio was shocked to learn of Rodrigo 's atheism and rejection of the Bible , despite his papacy . Rodrigo then scoffed that Ezio was still too naive . Rodrigo then replied : I became Pope because it gave me ACCESS . It gave me POWER . Do you think I believe a single god-damned word of that ridiculous book ? It 's all lies and superstition . Just like every OTHER religious tract written over the past ten thousand years\nAl Mualim | Assassin 's Creed ( 2007 video game ) | During his final fight with Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad in Masyaf and brief talks about the Apple of Eden while the latter was bound by the Apple 's powers , Al Mualim confirmed that Altaïr was immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden , to which Altaïr asked what illusion it was . Al Mualim said : That 's all it 's ever done , this Templar treasure , this Piece of Eden , this word of God . Do you understand now ? The Red Sea was never parted , water never turned to wine . It was not the machinations of Eris that spawned the Trojan War , but this ! Illusions , all of them ! Altaïr argued that what Al Mualim had planned was no less than an illusion , to force men to work for him against their will . Al Mualim then denies the existence of any God whatsoever , by saying : Is it any less real than the phantoms the Saracens and Crusaders follow now ? Those craven Gods , who retreat from this world that men might slaughter one another in their names ? They live amongst an illusion already . I 'm simply giving them another , one that demands less blood . Altaïr then said that they were safer choosing these phantoms , confirming that it was better to believe in some higher entity than believing in nothing at all . Al Mualim was disappointed , claiming that logic had left Altaïr 's mind and was replaced with emotion . Still unconvinced , Altaïr was released from being bound to the Apple 's power , after which he swiftly defeated Al Mualim in combat with some difficulty , finally ending his Mentor 's life by plunging his Hidden Blade into his throat . During Al Mualim 's final moments , he tells Altaïr to take the Apple , to which Altaïr replied to his Mentor that he held fire in his hand , which should have been destroyed . Al Mualim was not convinced even then , believing that the Apple could end the Crusades and create true peace and that he would never destroy it . Altaïr then promised him that he would destroy it , with the latter dying after challenging his student to truly destroy it\nMario Auditore | Assassin 's Creed II | When speaking of the Auditore Villa Pastor to Ezio , Mario says The prete ( priest ) seems a nice enough fellow , but I 've never been much of a believer\nArno Dorian | Assassin 's Creed Unity | By the end of the game , Arno described the Creed in strongly atheistic terms and claims that there exists no higher power to judge humanity nor does a supreme being watch over humanity or punishes them for their sins , and that only humanity itself can guard itself against its own obsessions\nAltaïr Ibn-La'Ahad | Assassin 's Creed ( 2007 video game ) | After starting to research on the Apple of Eden , Altaïr began to have doubts about the existence of a God , citing various conflicts and contradictions in the religious books available in the Holy Land during his time , noting how cruel they were in their punishments of those who rejected the books , and thus began noting them down in his Codex . Altaïr , much like Arno Dorian , professed the Assassin 's creed in strongly atheistic terms and called the light of God as a light that blinds society and forces it to stumble about in ignorance\nNiko Bellic | GTA IV | This main character often muses that he does not care whether or not God exists , saying that any faith he had died after the numerous atrocities that he witnessed and took part in during the war , however , in reality , he does not agree to this point and constantly shouts out to God to bless Liberty City . He states that because of his firsthand experience of seeing what human beings are capable of , he does not believe humans have souls . However , he did say that only barbaric creatures did not have any souls and that he did not know whether God is complicated or not\nTerrence Sweetwater | Battlefield : Bad Company 2 | During an idle conversation with Haggard , Sweetwater reveals that he rejects the concept of sin and a god , referring to them as superstition , as well as just stating that he does not believe in a god\nDr. Isiah Friedlander | GTA V | During a therapy session , when one of the main protagonists Michael de Santa asks whether Dr. Friedlander believes in evil , Dr. Friedlander simply replies that he is a man of science and that religion is used to relieve others ' tensions\n\nwiki_section_title: Video games\n\nwiki_section_text: \n\nintro: The following is a list of fictional atheists and agnostics limited to notable characters who have, either through self-admission within canon works or through admission of the character creator(s), been associated with a disbelief in a supreme deity or follow an agnostic approach toward religious matters.\n\n"
