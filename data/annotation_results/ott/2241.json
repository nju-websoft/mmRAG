Derek Fisher , the 1996 Sun Belt Player of the Year , has won five NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers .\n\nintro: The Sun Belt Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, officially titled the Sun Belt Conference Men's Basketball Student-Athlete of the Year, is a basketball award given to the most outstanding men's basketball player in the Sun Belt Conference. The award was first given following the conference's first basketball season of 1976-77. Four players - Terry Catledge, Chris Gatling, Chico Fletcher, and R. J. Hunter - have been selected twice, while no player has earned a three-time player of the year selection. Western Kentucky, which left the Sun Belt for Conference USA in 2014, has the most all-time winners with seven. Among schools remaining in the Sun Belt beyond 2014, South Alabama, the only charter member that has continuously been in the conference, has the most winners with six. Six current Sun Belt Conference members have never had a winner, but only two of these schools joined before 2013.\n\n"
