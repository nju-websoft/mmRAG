Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. From 1947 to 1980, the American Baseball Coaches Association was the only All-American selector recognized by the NCAA.\n\n"
