In 2010, Michigan had a total summer capacity of 29,831 MW through all of its power plants. Michigan's energy mix in 2009 was 66% coal, 22% nuclear, 8% natural gas and 3% renewables but coal use has rapidly decreased with natural gas and renewables increasing. The leading source of renewable energy was wind power. Michigan imports all of its coal and nuclear fuel and 82% of its natural gas. A requirement to produce 10% of its electricity from in-state renewables by 2015 has led to the construction of new solar, wind and landfill gas plants. Major electric companies in Michigan are Detroit Edison (11,000 MW) and Consumers Power (9,000 MW). In 2014 Michigan produced 50% of its electricity from coal.\n\n"
