The event is sponsored by the Liga Atlética Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico. The event usually include competitions in softball, basketball, beach volleyball, judo, table tennis, swimming, cheerleading, women's football, and athletics. The sporting event is supplemented by artistic presentations that take place after the events come to an end each night. The athletics portion of the events is attended by some 20,000 spectators, while the cultural events receive upwards of 150,000 guests. For many years the event was held in San Juan, but in 1993 it was moved to the city of Ponce, where - except for 2010 and 2016 - it has been held since. The week-long event takes place during the month of April. Due to the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes in the Ponce area, the 2020 edition of the Justas were moved from Ponce and are scheduled to take place in Mayagüez from 23 to 25 April at the Jose Antonio Figueroa Freyle Stadium.\n\n"

However, it does not provide any information about the percentage of graduate students at these institutions, making it unable to directly address the query or infer additional information required to answer it."
