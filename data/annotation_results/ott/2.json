The United Kingdom as a whole is the 10th most visited country. London, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, York, and Canterbury remain popular historic tourist destinations. England's long history and pervasive culture, make it (and especially London) a popular tourist destination. Many tourist spots have witnessed great events of history that have shaped England and the greater world. Many of England's tourist attractions have also inspired work of poets, novelists, folk writers, and artists for thousands of years. The city of Manchester, famous for being the first industrialised city, and Liverpool, the famous birthplace of The Beatles are also popular tourist destinations that show the more modern side to England.\n\n"
