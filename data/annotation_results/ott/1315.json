It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held April 21-22, 1991, at the Marriott Marquis in New York City, New York. On that day, Raghib Rocket Ismail from the University of Notre Dame, who was projected as the number one overall pick, instead signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). No teams elected to claim any players in the supplemental draft that year. The first six selections of the draft were defensive players. No previous draft had begun with more than three consecutive defensive picks.\n\n"
