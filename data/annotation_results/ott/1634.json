It is the seventeenth countdown of the most popular songs of the year, as chosen by the listeners of Australian radio station Triple J. Voting commenced on Boxing Day, 26 December 2009, and closed on 17 January 2010. 1.1 million votes were received, a record number. Controversy began when it was rumoured that the winner had been unintentionally leaked by the ABC. The ABC Shop website promoted the February issue of Jmag with a description stating Topping the 2009 countdown is Mumford & Sons' 'Little Lion Man'. Triple J neither confirmed nor denied the rumour with some even claiming it was a hoax, amounting to a clever marketing campaign. The leak led Sportingbet Australia to close all betting on the countdown. The leak proved to be accurate. For the first time, the number one song was performed live on air by the winning artist, Mumford & Sons, from Triple J studios, followed by the studio version of the song.\n\n"
