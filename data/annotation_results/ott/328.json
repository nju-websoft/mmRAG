The present list intends to include all the international and domestic airports located in the area geographically defined as Central America, comprising Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. Because each country has a different body to control these statistics, the compilation of data is difficult and not homogeneously distributed. The information here presented represents the best available data in different Internet sources. The ranking is ordered according to total passenger traffic (unless the footnotes indicate otherwise). Information on aircraft movements or cargo movements is not available for all the airports.\n\n"

                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not specify which creek is at the mouth of the city served by the airport.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, the document confirms the association between Belize City and Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport, which could guide further investigation regarding geographic features like creeks.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "While the document confirms the city associated with Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport (Belize City), which is relevant and partially answers the query, it does not provide information about Haulover Creek. Thus, it provides useful background but does not deliver a complete answer."
