The guide was originally developed in 1900 to show French drivers where local amenities such as restaurants and mechanics were. The rating system was first introduced in 1926 as a single star, with the second and third stars introduced in 1933. According to the Guide, one star signifies a very good restaurant, two stars are excellent cooking that is worth a detour, and three stars mean exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey. The listing of starred restaurants is updated once a year.\n\n"
