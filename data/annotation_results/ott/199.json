Unlike its sister pageants Miss Universe and Miss USA, which are broadcast on Fox, this pageant is webcast on the Miss Teen USA website and simulcast on mobile devices and video game consoles. The pageant was first held in 1983 and has been broadcast live on CBS until 2002 and then on NBC from 2003-2007. In March 2007, it was announced that the broadcast of the Miss Teen USA pageant on NBC had not been renewed, and that Miss Teen USA 2007 would be the final televised event. From 2008-15, the pageant was held at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort, located in Nassau, Bahamas. Notable pageant winners include actresses Kelly Hu (1985, Hawaii), Bridgette Wilson (1990, Oregon), Charlotte Lopez-Ayanna (1993, Vermont), Vanessa Minnillo (1998, South Carolina) and Shelley Hennig (2004, Louisiana). The current titleholder is Kaliegh Garris of Connecticut who was crowned on April 28, 2019 at Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada.\n\n"
