Founded on January 9, 1914 on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C., Phi Beta Sigma has opened chapters at other colleges, universities, and cities, and named them with Greek-letters. The fraternity's expansion started with its second (Beta) and third (Gamma) chapters, chartered at Wiley College and Morgan State College respectively in 1915. Today, the fraternity serves through a membership of more than 200,000 men in over 700 chapters in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean. The fraternity has reserved the designation Omega chapter as a memorial to those brothers who are deceased. Graduate chapters are indicated by Sigma at the end of their chapter name.\n\n"
