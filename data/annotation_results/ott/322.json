It replaced the Welsh Professional Championship, which started in 1980 and was only open to Welsh players. Since the tournament's creation in 1992, Mark Williams has been the only Welsh player to win the championship (in 1996 and 1999). John Higgins holds the record for the most wins, with five Welsh Open titles. Ronnie O'Sullivan has won four titles, while Stephen Hendry has won the tournament three times. Shaun Murphy is the reigning champion.\n\n"
