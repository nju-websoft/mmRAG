With NPR 's increasing news-heavy direction though , the classical music that makes up the network has been reduced to non-prime periods on the network , with NPR 's programming airing in morning rush and afternoon drive , along with the evening . Music is programmed locally during daytime hours , with network programming from Classical 24 being carried in late evenings and overnight . These programs include NPR 's Morning Edition , All Things Considered , Fresh Air and Weekend Edition , as well as APM 's Marketplace ( it also carries Morning Marketplace during Morning Edition ) , the BBC World Service 's Newshour , along with Live from Here . The network also carries weekend jazz , folk and world music programming - including Higher Ground , hosted by Dr. Jonathan Overby on Saturday nights ( this program is also heard on WPR 's Milwaukee-based Ideas Network Station WHAD ) . Other forms of music such as blues , new-age , and Native American music can be heard regionally . A few Ideas Network stations in areas not served by this network carry the above programs in place of the master Ideas Network schedule . The flagship station of the NPR News and Classical Network is WERN in Madison .\n\nintro: Wisconsin Public Radio is a network of 34 public radio stations in the state of Wisconsin. WPR's network is divided into two distinct analog services, the Ideas Network and the NPR News and Classical Network, as well as the HD2 Classical Service, a digital-only, full-time classical music service.\n\n"
