The change is limited to Catholic schools ; almost all others ( state and independent ) remain K-7 schools .\n\nintro: This is a list of schools in the city of Perth, Western Australia. The Western Australian education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from kindergarten to Year 6, and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12. Previously primary schools accounted for Year 7 education, but in 2015 all Western Australian schools transitioned Year 7 to be a part of the high school system. In country areas, district high schools serve as both primary and junior high schools, with students generally commuting to or boarding at larger towns to finish the last two years of their education.\n\n"
