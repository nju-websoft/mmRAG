It was first presented in 2004 to Goldenhorse for Maybe Tomorrow. No award was presented in 2005, but in 2006 it was reintroduced, with The Feelers claiming it for their single Stand Up. Brooke Fraser's Deciphering Me followed in 2007, while Opshop won the award in 2008 with Maybe. In 2009, Always on My Mind, by Tiki Taane, was awarded the title. Stan Walker twice won the award two years in a row - in 2010 with Black Box and in 2011 with Choose You, and again with Take It Easy in 2013 and Bulletproof in 2014.\n\n"
