They are generally suspended in dedicated bell towers or shōrō . The oldest extant of these bells date to the late-7th century and have been designated as National Treasures . The bells were either engraved or cast in relief , with outer surfaces showing vertical and horizontal relief bands , a boss ornament on the upper wall that sometimes included text , and handles typically shaped in a dragon motif . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Thirteen Japanese and one Korean temple bell have been designated as National Treasures . [ 4 ]\n\nintro: The term National Treasure has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897,\nalthough the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The crafts items in the list adhere to the current definition and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their especially high historical or artistic value. The list presents 131 entries from Classical to early modern Japan, spanning from the 7th century Asuka to the 18th century Edo period. The number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The listed objects are of many types and include household goods, objects related to Buddhism, armour and harnesses. Some of the oldest objects were imported from China at the time. The listed items consist of materials such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated using a variety of artistic techniques like gilding of precious metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl inlay or lacquer. The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines or museums. The objects in this list represent about half of the 253 National Treasures in the category crafts. They are complemented by 110 swords and 12 Japanese sword mountings National Treasures of the List of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: swords).\n\n"
