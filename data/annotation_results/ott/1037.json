A full list is externally linked : List of death row inmates in Ohio\n\nintro: As of October 1, 2019, there were 2,639 death row inmates in the United States. The number of death row inmates changes daily with new convictions, appellate decisions overturning conviction or sentence alone, commutations, or deaths (through execution or otherwise). Due to this fluctuation as well as lag and inconsistencies in inmate reporting procedures across jurisdictions, the information in this article may be out of date.\n\n"
