In total there are 22 electoral districts in Nunavut spread over three administrative regions. Each district elects one member to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut in a first past the post system. Unlike some other parts of Canada, such as Ontario, a new by-election must be held in a riding if the original result ended in a tie. There are no political parties in Nunavut, each candidate runs as an independent and the territory operates by consensus government.\n\n"
