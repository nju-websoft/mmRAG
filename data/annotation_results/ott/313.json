Eurasia is a continent comprising the traditional continents of Europe and Asia. It is divided from Africa by the Isthmus of Suez. Some states such as Malta are traditionally part of Eurasia, however they lie on the African tectonic plate. It is separated from Australasia (Oceania) somewhere in the Malay archipelago, and is usually considered as including Indonesia and Timor-Leste (East Timor). Some areas are associated with Eurasian states, being part of them or dependent upon them, but are not physically in it. Examples are the Danish territory of Greenland, French overseas departments, some British Overseas Territories, and the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n"
