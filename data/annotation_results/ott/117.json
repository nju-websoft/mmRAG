The league winner had access to the UEFA Champions League qualifications rounds , and the 2nd , 3rd and the Cup winner had played in the UEFA Cup . The bottom clubs would be relegated to the two Second Leagues depending on the republic they were based in , the Second League of Serbia ( Druga savezna liga Srbija ) and the Second League of Montenegro ( Druga savezna liga grupa Crna Gora ) . In 2002 , FR Yugoslavia changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro , and the league was named First League of Serbia and Montenegro between 2002 and its dissolution , in 2006 . In 2006 Serbia and Montenegro separated and formed their own top leagues ( Serbian SuperLiga and Montenegrin First League ) . Serbian SuperLiga was officially declared the successor of the First Leagues of FR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro . A total of 41 clubs participated between 1992 and 2006 , being 34 from Serbia , 6 from Montenegro and one from Bosnia and Herzegovina ( Borac Banja Luka was temporarily based in Serbia in early 1990s ) . A total of 3 clubs were champions , all from Serbia , Partizan ( 8 times ) , Red Star ( 5 times ) and Obilić ( once ) .\n\nintro: The Serbian SuperLiga (Serbian: Суперлига Србије / Superliga Srbije), known as the Linglong Tire SuperLiga for sponsorship reasons, is a Serbian professional league for football clubs. At the top of the Serbian football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. It is contested by 16 clubs, operating a system of promotion and relegation with the Serbian First League (Prva liga Srbija, second Serbian football tier). The SuperLiga was formed during the summer of 2005 as the country's top football league competition in Serbia and Montenegro. Since summer 2006 after the secession of Montenegro from Serbia, the league only has had Serbian clubs. Serbian clubs used to compete in the Yugoslav First League. This competition was formed in 1923 and lasted until 2003. After the downfall of SFR Yugoslavia in 1991 a new Yugoslavia would be formed that would be named FR Yugoslavia with Montenegro and Serbia. They kept the name Yugoslavia until 2003 when the country changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro: this union lasted until 2006 when Montenegro gained independence and formed its own league, the Montenegrin First League. The current SuperLiga champions are Red Star Belgrade. UEFA currently ranks the league 18th in Europe of 55 leagues. The league was known as Meridian Prva liga/Super liga from 2004 until 2008.\n\n"
