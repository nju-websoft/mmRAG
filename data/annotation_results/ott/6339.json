In 2010, the city had a population of 39,558. It was incorporated on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township. It borders Absecon, Brigantine, Pleasantville, Ventnor City, Egg Harbor Township, and the Atlantic Ocean.

In 1976, New Jersey voters legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City. The first casino opened two years later.\n\n"
