She made her stage debut playing Rosaline in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost at the Globe Theatre (2007), and first appeared on film in the comedy St Trinian's (2007). Her breakthrough role was playing Bond Girl Strawberry Fields in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace in the following year, a performance which won her an Empire Award for Best Newcomer. Arterton has since gone on to appear in a number of blockbuster films, including Clash of the Titans (2010), Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013) as well as several smaller, art house pictures such as The Disappearance of Alice Creed (2009), Tamara Drewe (2010), The Escape (2017) and Vita and Virginia (2018). She was awarded the Harper's Bazaar Woman of the Year Award for her work both acting in and producing The Escape. Arterton's theatrical highlights have included starring in The Duchess of Malfi (2014), Made in Dagenham (2014), Nell Gwynn (2016) and Saint Joan (2017). She was nominated for Olivier Awards for her work on both Nell Gwynn and Made in Dagenham, and she won the Evening Standard Theatre Award for the latter. Since 2016 Arterton has run her own production company, Rebel Park Productions, which focuses on creating female-led content both in front of, and behind the camera. She has executive produced four feature films and two short films. Arterton is also on record as being a prominent supporter of the Time'sUp, ERA 50:50 and MeToo movements. Arterton played an integral role in persuading actresses to wear black at the 2018 Baftas in support of Time'sUp, and has been involved with ERA 50:50, an equal pay campaign in the UK, since its conception.\n\n"
