This is a table listing of Fox affiliates, with Fox-owned stations separated from privately-owned affiliates, and arranged by market ranking based on data compiled by Nielsen Media Research. Eventually, there will be links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their local programming, hosts and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies. The station's advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is their PSIP virtual channel number, representing their pre-digital transition over-the-air frequency.\n\n"
