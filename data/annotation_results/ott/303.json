Designated places are defined by provinces and territories of Canada in cooperation with Statistics Canada, and Quebec has two kinds: dissolved municipalities (French: municipalité dissoute) and unconstituted localities. Dissolved municipalities are often the result of mergers and amalgamations (see Municipal history of Quebec and Category:Former municipalities in Quebec), and in some cases Statistics Canada chooses to keep tracking population and other figures for census purposes over the territory of the pre-merger municipality. However, unconstituted localities never had the status of municipality to begin with. An unconstituted locality will necessarily exist on the territory of some municipality (or unorganized territory).\n\n"
