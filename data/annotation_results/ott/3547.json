In Bangalore the Cholas ruled nearly a century. The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power, including the present-day Bangalore. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola I - around 1004 AD - the cholas captured Bangalore after defeating the Gangas. During their rule, they built many temples in and around Bangalore with the Chokkanathaswamy temple, Mukthi Natheshwara Temple, Choleswara temple and the Someshwara Temple being prominent ones. The Chokkanathaswamy temple at Domlur, whose earliest inscriptions date back to the 10th century AD, is the oldest temple in the city. Originally built by Raja Raja Chola I, the temple was later renovated by the Hoysalas and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple's deity was Lord Shiva, but later a Vishnu temple was built for the local residents who were mainly Vaishnavas. The Chola Rule in Karnataka was curtailed with loss of Western Gangavadi in 1117 AD by the Hoysalas, but Eastern Gangavadi (part of Mysore district) was recovered by 1125 AD under Vikrama Chola and Chola territories in Kannada country existed till the rule of Emperor Kulothunga Chola III. However Tamil habitation in Karnataka, especially in Mysore district, precedes the Chola period and continued afterwards as well. The Chola rule was the primary reason for the Saivism to be deeply routed in Southern India. Hoysala Kings built Someshwara temples throughout their kingdom.\n\n"

                "Answer Analysis": "The answer identifies the Someshwara Temple located in Halasuru as the temple matching the query.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides a list of Chola temples in Bangalore. For each temple, it lists details such as the name, locality, and earliest period or inscription. Additionally, it provides historical context of the Chola dynasty and their temples built in Bangalore. Notable temples in the list include Someshwara Temple (Halasuru) and others located in various neighborhoods such as Kadugodi, Domlur, and Kengeri.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'Chola temple', 'Bangalore', and includes specific temple names and localities (e.g., Halasuru). However, 'MG Road' or its vicinity is not explicitly mentioned.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document explicitly mentions 'Someshwara Temple' in Halasuru, which matches the answer provided in the query.",
                "Key Information Matching": "While the document lists Someshwara Temple in Halasuru, which matches the answer, it does not explicitly provide geographic information about Halasuru bordering one end of MG Road. However, the inclusion of Halasuru helps infer that the document is partially relevant as the locality is well-known to satisfy the query.",

                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant as it lists the Someshwara Temple in Halasuru, directly matching the answer. It does not provide explicit information linking Halasuru to MG Road, but someone familiar with the geography could infer the connection, making it partially helpful in answering the query."
