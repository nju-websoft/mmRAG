Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The NCAA recognizes two different All-America selectors for the 1990 college baseball season: the American Baseball Coaches Association (since 1947) and Baseball America (since 1981).\n\n"
