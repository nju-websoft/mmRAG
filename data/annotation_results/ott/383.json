[ 11 ] Wales ' Sam Warburton was named captain ; at the age of 24 , he was the youngest man to lead the Lions . Warburton was captain of Wales during their Six Nations Grand Slam in 2012 , and during the 2011 World Cup , where they finished fourth . Previous Lions captains Paul O'Connell ( from 2009 ) and Brian O'Driscoll ( 2005 ) were also chosen . Dylan Hartley was initially selected but was removed from the squad before the squad departed , after being suspended for 11 weeks for abusing a referee . [ 12 ] Rory Best replaced Hartley later that day , [ 13 ] meaning that the squad that set off to Hong Kong on 27 May consisted of 15 Welsh , 10 Irish , nine English and three Scottish players . Alex Corbisiero was called up to the squad to replace Cian Healy , who suffered ankle ligament damage in the match against the Western Force , [ 14 ] while Ryan Grant was called up to replace the injured Gethin Jenkins . [ 15 ] Tommy Bowe broke his hand against the Queensland Reds , [ 16 ] and Simon Zebo was brought into the squad . [ 17 ] England 's Brad Barritt , Christian Wade and Billy Twelvetrees were called in to provide further cover for the backs . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Gatland made a surprise selection on 16 June , calling up former Wales wing Shane Williams for the game against the Brumbies . Williams , playing club rugby in Japan , was already due to travel to Australia as a radio commentator , and was brought into the squad for only three days . [ 21 ] Ireland prop Tom Court was called up on 23 June before the final mid-week fixture against Melbourne Rebels , allowing Mako Vunipola to miss that match . Alex Corbisiero had injured his calf in the first test , so the Lions faced a shortage of props . Court was already in Australia visiting his home town of Brisbane . [ 22 ] O'Connell and Warburton were injured in the first and second tests respectively , ruling them out of playing in any more games in the tour .\n\nintro: The 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia was a rugby union tour during June and July 2013. The Lions played ten matches - a three-test series against Australia, and matches against the five Australian Super Rugby sides, a Combined New South Wales-Queensland Country team, and a match en route to Australia against the Barbarians. The Lions won the test series 2-1. The first test was won by the Lions 23-21, the second by Australia 16-15, and the final test by the Lions 41-16. The victory was the Lions' first test series win since defeating South Africa in 1997. Aside from the second test, the Lions' only loss was 14-12 to the Brumbies in Canberra. Wales head coach Warren Gatland was the Lions' head coach, and their tour captain was Sam Warburton.\n\n"
