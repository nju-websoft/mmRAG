He trained under J. Coxedge in Kensington, London. He initially designed two churches in King's Lynn, followed by nine Commissioners' churches. He then designed more new churches, and rebuilt or remodelled other churches, for different clients, and also gained commissions for civic and public buildings. Most of his church designs were in Gothic Revival style, while those for civic and public buildings were mainly Neoclassical. Later in his career he became involved in domestic architecture. He also unsuccessfully created many designs for other buildings, such as King's College, Cambridge, and the new Houses of Parliament. He died suddenly in London, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\n"
