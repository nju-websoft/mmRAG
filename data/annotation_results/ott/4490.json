It was held on Tuesday, July 16, 2013 at Citi Field in Queens, New York City, the home of the New York Mets. This was the first time that the Mets have hosted an All-Star Game since 1964, the team's inaugural season at Shea Stadium, and the ninth time the All-Star Game was held in New York City. The game was last held in New York City in 2008, when the old Yankee Stadium hosted it in its final season before being demolished. It was televised in the United States on Fox. The American League shut out the National League for the seventh time in All-Star game history, marking the first time that there have been shutouts in consecutive All-Star games.\n\n"
