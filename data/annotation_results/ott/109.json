Some of these terms are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion. For example, the genome contains the ORFeome, which gives rise to the transcriptome, which is translated to the proteome. Other terms are overlapping and refer to the structure and/or function of a subset of proteins (e.g. glycome, kinome). An omicist is a scientist who studies omeomics, cataloging all the omics subfields. Omics.org is a Wiki that collects and alphabetically lists all the known omes and omics.\n\n"
