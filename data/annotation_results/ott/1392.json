A report on the men's event was given in the Glasgow Herald. This was the last competition organized by the International Cross Country Union (ICCU). The organization of the event was transferred to the IAAF as recommended as a result of the meeting of the IAAF cross-country committee that year in London. It was continued as IAAF World Cross Country Championships. From then on, the event was open for all IAAF members whereas before, non-ICCU members were only allowed to compete after special invitation. Complete results for men, junior men, women, medallists, \n and the results of British athletes were published.\n\n"
