From 2011-2014, the race served as the World Triathlon Corporation's 5150 Series U.S. Championships. Previously, it was part of the ITU Triathlon World Cup series from 2008 to 2010. The annual triathlon event attracted many of the top professional triathletes in the world due, in part, to having the largest prize purse awarded for Olympic-distance races in the sport (and from 2008-12, the largest in the sport overall). In addition to professional triathletes, the triathlon event features competition among amateur athletes as well.\n\n"
