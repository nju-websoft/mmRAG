This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day . [ 18 ] However , there are a few N-prefixed route numbers that have no relation to their daytime equivalents : the N5 , N20 , and N97 all operate in a different part of London to their respective day routes , and the N550 and N551 ( which provide night service on parts of the DLR network ) have no corresponding daytime routes . [ 18 ] There are also 24-hour routes , which run day and night but usually with a lower frequency during the night hours . The vast majority run the same route at all times . With the introduction of the Night Tube , some day routes have been extended to run during Friday and Saturday nights to serve the stations .\n\nintro: This is a list of Transport for London (TfL) contracted bus routes in London, England, as well as commercial services that enter the Greater London area (except coaches). Bus services in London are operated by Abellio London, Arriva London, HCT Group, Go-Ahead London (Blue Triangle, Docklands Buses, London Central, and London General), Metroline, RATP Group (London Sovereign, London United, and Quality Line) Stagecoach London (East London, Selkent, and Thameside), Sullivan Buses, Tower Transit, and Uno. TfL-sponsored operators run more than 500 services. Non-TfL-sponsored operators including Arriva Shires & Essex, Arriva Southern Counties, Cardinal Buses, Carousel Buses, Go-Coach, First Berkshire & The Thames Valley, Hallmark Connections, Metrobus, Red Rose Travel, Southdown PSV, Stagecoach South, Trustybus, and Uno operate services between parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex on the one hand and London on the other, with one local council-sponsored service each in the boroughs of Bexley, Barking & Dagenham, and Hackney (extending into Islington).\n\n"
