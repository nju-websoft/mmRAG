[ 46 ] [ 47 ] `` Total nonfarm employment , over-the-year percent change in the United States and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , March 1999-2009 '' [ 48 ] The following is a list of the top ten private employers in Pittsburgh . [ 49 ]\n\nintro: The economy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is diversified, focused on services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters and high technology. Once the center of the American steel industry, and still known as The Steel City, today the city of Pittsburgh has no steel mills within its limits, though Pittsburgh-based companies such as US Steel, Ampco Pittsburgh and Allegheny Technologies own several working mills in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Pittsburgh was chosen for the 2009 G-20 summit as its transformation is an example of a 21st-century economy. On September 8, 2009, President Barack Obama stated, Pittsburgh stands as a bold example of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century economy. On the list of best cities for job growth in 2009, created by Tara Weiss, a writer for Forbes magazine, Pittsburgh secured its spot because of its strength in the health care and education industries with healthy foundations in technology or robotics and banking industries. The 2009 list of all cities places Pittsburgh as the 169th-best city for job growth. Pittsburgh has also ranked in the top five most livable cities in four of the seven multi-year rankings of Places Rated Almanac (1983, 1985, 1989, and 2007).\n\n"
