The following list sorts the stations according to their service line. The current system was formed after the merger with the Kowloon-Canton Railway on 2 December 2007, when the operations of the East Rail Line, the West Rail Line, the Ma On Shan Line and the Light Rail system were transferred to the MTR Corporation. Serving exclusively the northwestern New Territories, the light rail network comprises 12 routes, serving 68 stops. The network is being expanded and several new lines are being proposed or under construction.\n\n"
