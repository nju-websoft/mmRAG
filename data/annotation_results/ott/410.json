It began on March 19, 2013, and concluded with the championship game on April 8, 2013, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. This was the 75th edition of the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship, dating to 1939. The Final Four consisted of Louisville, Wichita State (second ever appearance), Syracuse (first appearance since their 2003 national championship), and Michigan, returning for the first time since the Fab Five's second appearance in 1993 (which was later vacated). By winning the West Region, Wichita State became the first #9 seed and first Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) team to reach the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The last #9 seed to reach the Final Four was Penn, and the last MVC team to do so was Indiana State, both in 1979. Louisville defeated Michigan in the championship game by a final score of 82-76, winning their first national title since 1986. They also are the last team from the original Big East Conference to win a national championship. On February 20, 2018, the NCAA vacated Louisville's entire tournament run, including its national title, due to multiple recruiting violations. The tournament featured several notable upsets: at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won at least once in the tournament, The most notable was Florida Gulf Coast University, who made their tournament debut in only their second year of Division I eligibility. They upset Georgetown and San Diego State in their first two games, becoming the first #15 seed to advance to the regional semifinals (where they were defeated by Florida). For the first time since 2010, a #14 seed won as Harvard defeated New Mexico in the West Region.\n\n"
