Under this system , promotion and relegation between Super League and Championship was abolished , and 14 teams were granted licences subject to certain criteria . All existing Super League teams except Crusaders ( who pulled out of the application process ) earned a place in the 2012 season , Championship team Widnes Vikings were given a licence after their application was deemed better than Halifax and Barrow Raiders . Geographically , the vast majority of teams in Super League are based in the north of England , five teams – Warrington , St. Helens , Salford , Wigan and Widnes – to the west of the Pennines in Cheshire , Greater Manchester and Merseyside , and seven teams to the east in Yorkshire – Huddersfield , Bradford , Wakefield Trinity , Leeds , Castleford , Hull F.C . and Hull Kingston Rovers . Catalans Dragons are the only team based in France and are outside of the UK and London Broncos are the only team to be based in a capital city ( London ) .

Fourteen teams competed for the League Leaders' Shield over 27 rounds (including the Magic Weekend at Manchester's Etihad Stadium), which was won by the Wigan Warriors. After the regular season, the 8 highest finishing teams entered the play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final and a chance to win the championship and the Super League Trophy. The season kicked off on 3 February with two Round 1 fixtures being played: the Widnes Vikings, in their first Super League match since 2005, lost to the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, while defending champions the Leeds Rhinos defeated the Hull Kingston Rovers and ended on 6 October with Leeds Rhinos beating Warrington Wolves 26-18 in the 2012 Super League Grand Final.\n\n"
