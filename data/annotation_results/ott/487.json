                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'South African airport' and provides the IATA code 'UTN' for Upington Airport.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document does not mention '4900 metres' or directly refer to runway length.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document identifies the IATA code 'UTN' which corresponds to Upington Airport but does not provide information regarding the runway length.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not contain information about the runway length.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, it identifies Upington Airport as the airport with IATA code UTN, which might help in further research regarding runway length elsewhere.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document is partially relevant because it identifies the airport corresponding to the IATA code UTN, which is part of the query. However, it does not provide runway length information needed to directly answer the query. Thus, it is somewhat related but not completely aligned with the main topic of runway length."
