They have played at their home ground, Ibrox, since 1899. Rangers were founding members of the Scottish Football League in 1890, and the Scottish Premier League in 1998. Rangers have won 54 domestic top-flight league titles more national titles than any other professional football club in the world. The club not only holds the record for the most league titles but also holds the world record for the most domestic trophies won, recognised by UEFA, winning 118 in all (including four lower division competitions, but not regional tournaments such as the Glasgow Cup or wartime competitions). The club's record appearance maker is John Greig, who made 755 appearances between 1961 and 1978 in all matches. Ally McCoist is the club's record goalscorer, scoring 355 goals during his Rangers career. This list encompasses the major honours won by Rangers as well as records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who had made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Rangers players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. Attendance records at Ibrox are also included in the list.\n\n"
