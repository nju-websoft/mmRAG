The tournaments were sanctioned by the United States-based Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). Total prize money for all tournaments was $45,100,000. Annika Sörenstam dominated the Tour in 2005, winning ten tournaments, including two of the four major tournaments, winning more than $2 million in prize money for the fifth consecutive season. Five other players earned over $1 million. Players from South Korea continued to be a growing force on the Tour, with seven different Korean players winning tournaments, including the two majors not won by Sörenstam: Birdie Kim at the U.S. Women's Open and Jeong Jang at the Women's British Open\nFor details of what happened in the main tournaments of the year see 2005 in golf.\n\n"
