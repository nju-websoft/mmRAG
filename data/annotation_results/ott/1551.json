All stations are operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. This list includes all rapid transit, light rail, and bus rapid transit (BRT) stations currently open on the MBTA's subway system. As of 2019[update], the system has 149 stops and stations served by the Green, Blue, Red, Orange, and Silver lines. These range in scale from marked stops on the Green and Silver lines with no fixed infrastructure, to sprawling underground complexes at the downtown transfer stations. Boylston and Park Street stations, which opened in 1897, were the first two subway stations in the United States.\n\n"
