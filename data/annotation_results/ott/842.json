Only the capacity for indoor sports, such as basketball, ice hockey, and volleyball, are included. Currently all arenas with a capacity of 15,000 or more are included. AT&T Stadium (Dallas, Texas, US), the Carrier Dome (Syracuse, New York, US) and the Stade Pierre-Mauroy (Lille, France), are not included as they are dome and retractable roof stadiums built for field sports that also host indoor events. The Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which does not have a retractable roof, has been excluded from this list; it regularly seats more than 70,000 people for basketball games (NCAA and NBA), boxing (over 65,000 for the Ali-Spinks Rematch), and more than 75,000 for professional wrestling. In 1981 the Rolling Stones reported Superdome attendance of 87,500 for a concert, while Pope John Paul II spoke to a crowd of more than 80,000 children in 1987. The confusion of what is an Arena, Stadium or Dome is due to the fact that opinion and other arbitrary criteria that do not matter have been considered. Thus, there are no significant differences in the true definition between the three because each has incorporated design elements of the others, other than size and limitation of use of the space by original design. The best modern definition of an Arena is an indoor venue that typically holds less than 40,000 spectators. Domed and Indoor Stadiums for the most part are the same thing but hold more than 40,000 spectators. However, there is a strong push to separate removable roof/ sliding roof as a specific identifier for Dome venues. Architecturally, there really is no difference between an Indoor Stadium and a Domed Stadium other than the roof can be opened in good weather.\n\n"
