The award is dedicated to rewarding excellence in sports writing and was first awarded in 1989. As of 2016, the prize for winning the award is Â£28,000. Commenting on the prize's prestige, the 2005 winner Gary Imlach said although it is a sports book prize, it has the prestige and the commercial clout to lift the winning book out of the sport section.\n\n"
