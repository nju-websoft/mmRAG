        "List of places of worship in Sevenoaks District\nName | Location | Denomination/ Affiliation | Grade | Notes\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nSt Peter and St Paul 's Church | Ash 51°21′27″N 0°17′59″E / 51.3574°N 0.2996°E / 51.3574 ; 0.2996 ( St Peter and St Paul 's Church , Ash ) | Anglican | I | Thomas Graham Jackson 's sympathetic alterations of 1901-03 did little to change the appearance of the flint and sandstone 14th/15th-century church , whose dressings are mostly of a colourful red brick . There is much Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic detail throughout\nBessels Green Baptist Church | Bessels Green 51°16′42″N 0°09′32″E / 51.2783°N 0.1588°E / 51.2783 ; 0.1588 ( Bessels Green Baptist Chapel , Bessels Green ) | Baptist | II | The chapel is near the village 's most prominent house , the Victorian-era Bessels House , but is a century older . The manse adjoins ; it has square-headed rather than arched windows and a dormer in the tiled roof , but otherwise blends in with the painted brick chapel . Additions in the 19th century include two porches with bargeboards\nUnitarian Meeting House | Bessels Green 51°16′46″N 0°09′44″E / 51.2795°N 0.1622°E / 51.2795 ; 0.1622 ( Unitarian Meeting House , Bessels Green ) | Unitarian | II | Like the Baptist chapel , this is 18th-century and has a house attached . It originated in 1716 but was rebuilt in 1740 , retaining some of the older fabric . The chapel is single-storey and has a three- casement window façade . Mixed red and blue brickwork and some stonework make up the walls . The two-bay single-storey house was extended in the 19th century . The tiled roof is hipped and steeply sloping\nSt Martin 's Church | Brasted 51°16′47″N 0°06′15″E / 51.2796°N 0.1043°E / 51.2796 ; 0.1043 ( St Martin 's Church , Brasted ) | Anglican | II* | The 13th-century church ( which contained some older fabric ) was rebuilt by Alfred Waterhouse in 1864-65 and restored again after World War II ( when the windows were bombed out ) and in 1989 following fire damage . The walls are of sandstone , and there is a heavily buttressed west tower . Inside are some 17th-century alabaster monuments . Some of the windows have outstanding and innovative tracery designed by Waterhouse\nSt Botolph 's Church | Chevening 51°17′56″N 0°08′05″E / 51.2989°N 0.1347°E / 51.2989 ; 0.1347 ( St Botolph 's Church , Chevening ) | Anglican | I | The church has Saxon origins , but the present building is mostly 13th-century and the Perpendicular Gothic tower dates from after 1518 . W. D. Caroe 's restoration of 1901-02 added to some changes made in 1869 . Inside , an outstanding collection of monuments spanning several centuries are associated with nearby Chevening House . Flint , rubble and local ragstone are the main materials\nSt Mary 's Church | Chiddingstone 51°11′11″N 0°08′46″E / 51.1863°N 0.1462°E / 51.1863 ; 0.1462 ( St Mary 's Church , Chiddingstone ) | Anglican | II* | A fire in 1624 prompted rebuilding of this 14th-century church over the next five years . Evidence of 13th-century lancet windows survives , and there was a church here in Saxon times . The ornately decorated tower is Perp . Internal fittings by George Edmund Street and Thomas Earp and stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe are also of interest\nSt Luke 's Church | Chiddingstone Causeway 51°11′51″N 0°10′33″E / 51.1975°N 0.1758°E / 51.1975 ; 0.1758 ( St Luke 's Church , Chiddingstone Causeway ) | Anglican | II* | John Francis Bentley 's only Anglican church is loosely Decorated Gothic Revival in style , dates from 1897-98 and replaced a tin tabernacle . The tower is wide and short , the Bath Stone blocks meticulously laid and the windows placed with fastidious whimsy . The east window ( 1906 ) is German Expressionist in style\nChapel of the Good Shepherd | Chipstead 51°16′59″N 0°09′00″E / 51.2831°N 0.1499°E / 51.2831 ; 0.1499 ( Chapel of the Good Shepherd , Chipstead ) | Anglican | - | This is a chapel of ease in the parish of St Botolph 's Church , Chevening . Services are held at 8.00am on Sundays\nSt Mary Magdalene 's Church | Cowden 51°08′41″N 0°05′41″E / 51.1448°N 0.0948°E / 51.1448 ; 0.0948 ( St Mary Magdalene 's Church , Cowden ) | Anglican | I | The church is principally Decorated Gothic in style , with some Perpendicular Gothic elements . The nave was built first in the 13th century , followed by the chancel ( late 13th- or early 14th-century ) and the tower and its crooked spire ( 15th-century ) . Many of the internal fittings are of the same era . John Whichcord added an aisle and a gallery in 1838 ; a further restoration ( 1884 by W.O . Milne ) took out the iron columns he added . World War II bomb damage to the spire has been repaired\nAll Souls Church | Crockenhill 51°22′59″N 0°09′45″E / 51.3831°N 0.1626°E / 51.3831 ; 0.1626 ( All Souls Church , Crockenhill ) | Anglican | II | Edwin Nash designed this church in the Early English Gothic Revival style in 1851 using local ragstone and Caen stone . The nave and chancel are of different heights . There is no tower or steeple , but a clock face has been inserted in the gable end of the west elevation . The internal fittings are virtually complete and include stained glass of 1853 and a Henry Willis organ of 1856\nCrockenhill Baptist Church | Crockenhill 51°23′01″N 0°09′50″E / 51.3835°N 0.1640°E / 51.3835 ; 0.1640 ( Crockenhill Baptist Church , Crockenhill ) | Baptist | - | Under the name Crockenhill Baptist Chapel , this building was legally registered for marriages in July 1879 .

The nave and chancel are unequal in height , and a tower rises at the west end . Local stone was used throughout . Inside , Octavia Hill is commemorated by a carving dated 1912\nDunton Green Free Church | Dunton Green 51°17′33″N 0°10′06″E / 51.2925°N 0.1682°E / 51.2925 ; 0.1682 ( Dunton Green Free Church , Dunton Green ) | Congregational Federation | - | Congregationalists built a church on London Road in the village in 1873 , but it passed to another denomination when this new building on Station Road was finished in 1937 . The first service was held on 30 September 1937 . The church was linked to Sevenoaks Congregational Church until the 1960s\nSt Peter and St Paul 's Church | Edenbridge 51°11′46″N 0°04′00″E / 51.1961°N 0.0666°E / 51.1961 ; 0.0666 ( St Peter and St Paul 's Church , Edenbridge ) | Anglican | I | There is much 13th- and 14th-century fabric in this long , low sandstone-built church , and the south chapel ( a memorial to Richard Martyn ) can be precisely dated to 1499 . An Early English Gothic tower with a pyramidal spire dominates the west end . The elaborate pulpit is of the 1630s\nThe Eden Church | Edenbridge 51°11′41″N 0°03′57″E / 51.1948°N 0.0659°E / 51.1948 ; 0.0659 ( The Eden Church , Edenbridge ) | Baptist | - | \nSt Lawrence 's Church | Edenbridge 51°11′53″N 0°03′50″E / 51.1980°N 0.0639°E / 51.1980 ; 0.0639 ( St Lawrence 's Church , Edenbridge ) | Roman Catholic | - | The town 's Roman Catholic church stands on the High Street and is dedicated to Lawrence the Martyr .

John Shaw , Sr. and Ewan Christian carried out extensive restorations in 1830 and 1868-71 respectively . In the churchyard , Thomas Nash - uncle of architect John Nash - is buried in an elaborate cube-shaped mausoleum possibly designed by his nephew\nSt Mary 's Church | Fawkham 51°23′20″N 0°17′38″E / 51.3890°N 0.2939°E / 51.3890 ; 0.2939 ( St Mary 's Church , Fawkham ) | Anglican | I | This tiny chapel , in a wooded setting , has rendered walls and painted stonework around the windows , a large wooden porch and a tall weatherboarded bellcote on the tiled roof .

There is 13th- and 14th-century work inside , including a mural of Christ in Majesty\n\nwiki_section_title: Open places of worship\n\nwiki_section_text: \n\nintro: The district of Sevenoaks, one of 13 local government districts in the English county of Kent, has nearly 120 current and former places of worship. The town of Sevenoaks, the administrative centre of the area, has many of these - from its ancient Anglican parish church to Victorian chapels and 20th-century meeting places for various Christian denominations. Smaller towns such as Edenbridge, Swanley and Westerham are also well provided with places of worship; and the mostly rural district's villages and hamlets have many of their own, covering a wide variety of ages, architectural styles and denominations. As of 2020, 89 places of worship are in use in the district and a further 28 former churches and chapels no longer hold religious services but survive in alternative uses. Census results show that Christianity is followed by a majority of the district's residents. Nearly 50 Anglican churches currently serve the Church of England, the country's Established Church. Roman Catholics and worshippers affiliated with various Protestant Nonconformist, Pentecostal and other Christian denominations are accommodated in a variety of mostly 19th- and 20th-century chapels and meeting rooms: Baptists, Methodists and the United Reformed Church each maintain several congregations, there are seven Roman Catholic churches, and smaller groups such as the Open Brethren, Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses can also be found in the district. English Heritage has awarded listed status to 48 places of worship in the district of Sevenoaks. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest.\n\n"
