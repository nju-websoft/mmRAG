These creations were not recognised in English, Scots or Irish law, but the titles were used in Jacobite circles in Continental Europe and recognised by France, Spain and the Papacy. Jacobite peerages ceased to be created after 1760 except for a title created by the Young Pretender, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, for his illegitimate daughter in or before 1783. The following tables list the peerages and baronetcies created by the Stuart claimants in exile.\n\n"
