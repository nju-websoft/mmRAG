It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides. [Note 1]\n The more notable freshwater islands include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have had a role to play in Scottish history. Inchmurrin, the largest freshwater island in the British Isles, is in Loch Lomond, which contains thirty or more other islands. [Note 2]\n Various names are used repeatedly. Inch or Innis is a Scots word that can mean island (although it is also used for terra firma surrounded by marsh). Similarly, Eilean is the Gaelic for island. -holm is a common suffix for offshore islands in the north of Scotland and is derived from the Old Norse holmr, meaning a small and rounded islet. This list excludes artificial crannógs and the numerous small freshwater islands with no recorded name. [Note 3][Note 4]\n\n"
