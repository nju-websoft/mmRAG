The region is centred on the inland city of Toowoomba and the towns of Dalby, Roma, St George and Charleville. Prior to 2015, the Queensland education system consisted of primary schools, which accommodated students from kindergarten to Year 7 (ages 5-13), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 8 to 12 (ages 12-18). However, from 2015, Year 7 became the first year of high school.\n\n"
